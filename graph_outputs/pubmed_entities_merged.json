Comparative studies with ifosfamide on the immuno-labile DS carcinosarcoma. Stimulation of the autoimmune activity for approx. 20 days by BA 1, a N-(2-cyanoethylene)-urea. Novel prophylactic possibilities]. A report is given on the recent discovery of outstanding immunological properties in BA 1 [N-(2-cyanoethylene)-urea] having a (low) molecular mass M = 111.104. Experiments in 214 DS carcinosarcoma bearing Wistar rats have shown that BA 1, at a dosage of only about 12 percent LD50 (150 mg kg) and negligible lethality (1.7 percent), results in a recovery rate of 40 percent without hyperglycemia and, in one test, of 80 percent with hyperglycemia. Under otherwise unchanged conditions the reference substance ifosfamide (IF) -- a further development of cyclophosphamide -- applied without hyperglycemia in its most efficient dosage of 47 percent LD50 (150 mg kg) brought about a recovery rate of 25 percent at a lethality of 18 percent. (Contrary to BA 1, 250-min hyperglycemia caused no further improvement of the recovery rate.) However this comparison is characterized by the fact that both substances exhibit two quite different (complementary) mechanisms of action. Leucocyte counts made after application of the said cancerostatics and dosages have shown a pronounced stimulation with BA 1 and with ifosfamide, the known suppression in the post-therapeutic interval usually found with standard cancerostatics. In combination with the cited plaque test for BA 1, blood pictures then allow conclusions on the immunity status. Since IF can be taken as one of the most efficient cancerostatics--there is no other chemotherapeutic known up to now that has a more significant effect on the DS carcinosarcoma in rats -- these findings are of special importance. Finally, the total amount of leucocytes and lymphocytes as well as their time behaviour was determined from the blood picture of tumour-free rats after i.v. application of BA 1. The thus obtained numerical values clearly show that further research work on the prophylactic use of this substance seems to be necessary and very promising."

Stroma from either normal or PNH-like red cells is capable of inhibiting, to some extent, lysis in the sucrose test and enhancing lysis in the acidified-serum test. The same opposing effects are displayed by the exclusion peaks from Sephadex G-200 obtained from each stroma preparation, suggesting that the same factor could be responsible for both activities. Stromata and peaks also induce lysis of PNH-like cells in unacidified serum, indicating activation of complement through the alternate pathway. This is confirmed by immunoelectrophoretic observation. When serum previously activated through the alternate pathway is used in the sucrose test the amount of lysis is markedly reduced. This would indicate that the classical pathway activation can be controlled by the alternate pathway. The possible clinical significance of these factors in determining the haemolytic crisis in PNH patients is discussed."

The phosphorylated form of liver glycogen phosphorylase (alpha-1,4-glucan : orthophosphate alpha-glucosyl-transferase, EC 2.4.1.1) (phosphorylase a) is active and easily measured while the dephosphorylated form (phosphorylase b), in contrast to the muscle enzyme, has been reported to be essentially inactive even in the presence of AMP. We have purified both forms of phosphorylase from rat liver and studied the characteristics of each. Phosphorylase b activity can be measured with our assay conditions. The phosphorylase b we obtained was stimulated by high concentrations of sulfate, and was a substrate for muscle phosphorylase kinase whereas phosphorylase a was inhibited by sulfate, and was a substrate for liver phosphorylase phosphatase. Substrate binding to phosphorylase b was poor (KM glycogen = 2.5 mM, glucose-1-P = 250 mM) compared to phosphorylase a (KM glycogen = 1.8 mM, KM glucose-1-P = 0.7 mM). Liver phosphorylase b was active in the absence of AMP. However, AMP lowered the KM for glucose-1-P to 80 mM for purified phosphorylase b and to 60 mM for the enzyme in crude extract (Ka = 0.5 mM). Using appropriate substrate, buffer and AMP concentrations, assay conditions have been developed which allow determination of phosphorylase a and 90% of the phosphorylase b activity in liver extracts. Interconversion of the two forms can be demonstrated in vivo (under acute stimulation) and in vitro with little change in total activity. A decrease in total phosphorylase activity has been observed after prolonged starvation and in diabetes."

Porphyria followed the administration of hexachlorobenzene in doses of 280 mumol - kg-1 body weight, which were given daily through a gastric tube over a 20-day period. Serum gamma-GT activity and the activities of the lysosomal enzymes beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase and alpha-mannosidase were increased, whereas L-aspartate: 2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase and L-alanine: 2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase and L-alanine: 2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase remained unaltered. There was a considerable increase in liver microsomal protein, gamma-GT, cytochrome P-450, anilinehydroxylase, aminopyrine-demethylase and delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase. In the liver gamma-GT was detected in the microsomes as well as in the cytoplasm where enzymatic activity was higher. The high correlation coefficient between liver gamma-GT, cytochrome P-450 and delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase witnesses a hexachlorobenzene-induced gamma-GT formation in the liver. A statistically significant correlation between serum and liver gamma-GT activity was also found. These data strongly suggest that the increase in serum gamma-GT activity may result from the induction of the enzyme in the liver."

The last group of infants was reevaluated after recovery from diarrhoea and protein-calorie malnutrition. A bactericidal pH effect below 2-5 was observed. Bottle-fed controls had low pH values and low bacterial concentrations, whereas infants with chronic diarrhoea and protein-calorie malnutrition had high pH values and bacterial overgrowth, essentially of Gram-negative bacilli. After recovery, the only remaining alteration was the frequent isolation of yeast-like fungi in low concentrations. Infants with acute diarrhoea, except for the isolation more frequently of yeast-like fungi, presented no alterations; this seems to indicate that pH alterations and Gram-negative bacilli overgrowth occurred during the evolution of the disease to a chronic state. Breast-fed normal infants had hydrogen-ion concentrations similar to those of the chronic diarrhoea group, but without Gram-negative bacilli overgrowth, suggesting that other factors, besides pH, regulate bacterial growth in the gastric contents of these groups of infants."

The beige mouse is an animal model for the human Chediak-Higashi syndrome, a disease characterized by giant lysosomes in most cell types. In mice, treatment with androgenic hormones causes a 20-50-fold elevation in at least one kidney lysosomal enzyme, beta-glucuronidase. Beige mice treated with androgen had significantly higher kidney beta-glucuronidase, beta-galactosidase, and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (hexosaminidase) levels than normal mice. Other androgen-inducible enzymes and enzyme markers for the cytosol, mitochondria, and peroxisomes were not increased in kidney of beige mice. No significant lysosomal enzyme elevation was observed in five other organs of beige mice with or without androgen treatment, nor in kidneys of beige females not treated with androgen. Histochemical staining for glucuronidase together with subcellular fractionation showed that the higher glucuronidase content of beige mouse kidney is caused by a striking accumulation of giant glucuronidase-containing lysosomes in tubule cells near the corticomedullary boundary. In normal mice lysosomal enzymes are coordinately released into the lumen of the kidney tubules and appreciable amounts of lysosomal enzymes are present in the urine. Levels of urinary lysosomal enzymes are much lower in beige mice than in normal mice. It appears that lysosomes may accumulate in beige mice because of defective exocytosis resulting either from decreased intracellular motility of lysosomes or from their improper fusion with the plasma membrane. A similar defect could account for characteristics of the Chediak-Higashi syndrome."

The levels of plasma carotenoids were markedly reduced in broiler cockerels infected with Eimeria acervulina or E. tenella. The mechanisms of this depigmentation differed between the two species, being primarily associated with interference of absorption of xanthophyll (carotenoids) from the intestinal lumen with E. acervulina infection and with leakage through the damaged wall of the cecum with E. tenella infection. Chicks reared on an essentially carotenoid-free diet and inoculated with E. acervulina showed no detectable levels of carotenoids in the blood 48 hours after being changed to a diet containing 30 mg of xanthophyll/kg. Conversely, uninoculated chicks and chicks inoculated with E. tenella showed significant and similar increases in plasma levels of carotenoids. Chicks reared on a diet containing xanthophyll and inoculated with E. tenella showed a more rapid decrease in plasma carotenoids than did uninoculated controls when changed to a xanthophyll-free diet. In chicks fed high xanthophyll diets containing chromic oxide, no indication of malabsorption was seen in chicks infected with E. tenella compared with uninoculated controls, whereas chicks inoculated with E. acervulina showed significantly less xanthophyll absorption. Conversely, a marked increase in the xanthophyll : Cr2O3 ratio was observed in the cecal contents of chicks inoculated with E. tenella compared with uninuoculated controls or those inoculated with E. acervulina. Studies of uninoculated chicks pair-fed with chicks inoculated with E. acervulina or E. tenella indicated that the decrease in plasma carotenoids and increases in intestinal pH are not associated with the reduced intake of feed associated with infection. The studies involving uninoculated birds with reciprocal chagnes between high and low xanthophyll diets indicated that plasma carotenoids are a more rapid and sensitive means of measuring changes in pigmentation levels than are visual skin scores carotenoid levels from the skin."

In 19 subjects (25 p.cent), a more than 20 p.cent decrease from control value of FEV1 was recorded ten minutes after exercise ended. Exercise-induced bronchial obstruction was relieved by a beta adrenergic bronchodilator aerosol inhalation. In the group of 19 subjects having exercise-induced asthma, a significant positive correlation was found between pre-exercise FEV1 values and post-exercise FEV1 decreases. In the whole group of 75 subjects exercise-induced asthma was related to the severity of asthma and not to other clinical or physical characteristics of the subjects. From the data of other authors it appears that frequency of exercise-induced asthma is variable. The reasons of those differences are discussed."

Thirteen out of 18 young out-patients with simple schizophrenia under neuroleptic treatment completed a double-blind cross-over trial with Madopar [L-Dopa + benserazid (a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor)] and placebo. Nine patients were given 900 mg L-Dopa + 225 mg benserazid daily, 1 patient received 600 mg L-Dopa + 150 mg benserazid, and 3 patients, 300 mg L-Dopa + 75 mg benserazid. In these doses, L-Dopa was effective against emotional withdrawal, blunted affect, tendency to isolation and apathy, without inducing or aggravating productive, accessory symptoms. The activity score, according to the specific activity-withdrawal scale, was significantly increased (P less than 0.05), whereas the total BPRS score (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale) was slightly, but significantly reduced (P less than 0.05). In cases where L-Dopa had to be limited to 600 and 300 mg daily, a tendency to anxiety, distortion of thinking, and a sense of unreality were observed, depending on the dose of L-Dopa. In no case were gastrointestinal, cardiovascular or neurological side-effects observed."

N-acetyl-5-ASA is extracted directly from the acidified biological specimen, deacetylated, and the liberated 5-ASA subjected to a modified Bratton-Marshall reaction. The 5-ASA present in the specimen must be acetylated with acetic anhydride prior to extraction. The violet colored product of the Bratton-Marshall reaction has a lambdamax of 560 nm and conforms to Beer's law over the concentration range of 0-70 umg/ml. Average recoveries (+/- S.D., N = 6) OF 5-ASA added to rat and human urine and rat fecal homogenates were 91.6 +/- 4.9%, 102 +/- 6.0%, and 71.0 +/- 4.8%, respectively. Interference by SASP and its sulfapyridine metabolities is negligible. As demonstrated, the colorimetric method is of sufficient sensitivity for application in most metabolic and pharmacokinetic studies conducted with SASP in laboratory animals and man."

Gastric juice from 15 normals, 20 patients with gastric ulcer and 14 patients with erosive haemorrhagic gastroduodenitis was investigated in respect of its activity on unheated and heated fibrin plates and its content of FDP and plasminogen or plasmin with immunochemical methods. Gastric juice from normals showed no activity on unheated and heated fibrin plates, and no FDP or plasminogen could be demonstrated. In the patients with gastric ulcer the gastric juice showed little or no fibrinolytic activity on fibrin plates except in 2, who had regurgitation of duodenal juice and neutral pH of the juice. These patients had equally high activity on heated as on unheated plates and no plasmin could be demonstrated. It was shown that this activity was not due to fibrinolysis, but to non-specific proteolytic activity (probably trypsin). The patients with erosive haemorrhage gastroduodenitis exhibited quite a different picture. The gastric juice from these patients showed extremely high activity on fibrin plates, the activity was higher on unheated than on heated plates. The activity was inhibited in vitro by addition of EACA and in vivo after administration of AMCA. The occurence of plasmic could be demonstrated directly immunologically in the gastric juice. By comparsion of plasmin and trypsin in various assays it could further be improved that the gastric juice in these cases contained plasminogen activator and plasmin. The patients with erosive haemorrhagic gastroduodenitis showed no increase in fibrinolysis in the blood, but low values for plasminogen and alpha2-M, and the serum contained FDP. These findings in the blood and gastric juice were interpreted as signs of local fibrinolysis in the stomach and duodenum. There is reason to assume that this gastric fibrinolysis contributes substantially to the bleeding tendency. The effect of administration of AMCA on fibrinolytic activity and the haemorrhage lends support to the assumption of such a mechanism."

Renal biopsy showed minimal lesions in 150 patients (77%); in 85 of these biopsy was done 3 months to 16 years after onset of the nephrotic syndrome. Significant renal histological abnormalities in 45 cases were labelled as mesangiocapillary 8, mesangioproliferative 4, proliferative with extensive crescents 2, membranous 3, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis 9, focal global glomerulosclerosis 2, advanced nonspecific 8, and mild proliferative 9. Nephritic manifestations were mainly associated with significant renal lesions, which were more frequently encountered when the onset of disease was after the age of 5 years. Clearance of proteinuria with corticosteroid therapy was practically confined to patients with minimal or mild renal histological changes. Our findings suggest that the pattern of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome in Indian children is similar to that reported from Western countries."

(2) Among 18,587 medical inpatients, there were 34 patients admitted for BMD in the absence of neoplasia or prior cytotoxic drug therapy; one of the latter reported using chlorpromazine hydrochloride, but it is doubtful whether this drug was the cause of the BMD. (3) Among 24,795 medical, surgical, and gynecological patients surveyed over a ten-month period in 1972, there were four who were admitted for BMD; one of the latter had a reversible leukopenia attributed to trifluoperazine hydrochloride."

The total activity in the perigenital adipose tissue from obese mice was threefold greater than in the tissue from lean mice, but per g of adipose tissue the activity was twofold greater in tissue from lean mice. In liver, the activity in obese mice was elevated at 8 weeks of age, remained elevated up to 24 weeks and then decreased by half at 48 weeks, but at all ages was higher than that in lean mice. The decrease in desaturase activity of liver from obese mice at 48 weeks corresponded to a change in the fatty acid composition of liver lipids toward that found in lean mice. Whereas in adipose tissue much of the increased enzyme activity may be due to tissue hyperplasia, in liver it is mainly an increased activity per cell."

In vitro assays failed to demonstrate humoral or cellular sensitization of the recipient against donor-type antigens. Following conditioning with cyclophosphamide, prompt but only transient engraftment of the transplant occurred accompanied by signs of mild graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) of the liver. The results of a second bone marrow transplantation from the same donor cannot be evaluated due to early death of the recipient. It is concluded that bone marrow from unrelated, HL-A and MLC-identical donors may engraft without severe GVHD. Rejection of the graft in our patient may have been related to greater antigenic differences that can be expected to exist between HL-A and MLC-identical unrelated individuals than between HL-A and MLC-identical siblings. However, insufficient preparative immunosuppression with cyclophosphamide due to severe hepatic hemosiderosis appears equally likely as the cause of graft rejection. The possibly increased risk of graft rejection or severe GVHD should not preclude the use of unrelated HL-A and MLC-identical marrow donors, when histocompatible sibling donors are not available; but more potent immunosuppressive regimens than the cyclophosphamide protocol may be necessary to ensure permanent engraftment."

    "abstract": "Fluroxene toxicity induced by phenobarbital. Because of reports of fluroxene toxicity in man, the effect of phenobarbital treatment on the toxicity and metabolism of fluroxene was studied in 9 rhesus monkeys. Six monkeys that were exposed to a mean calculated alveolar fluroxene concentration of 5.8% for 4-hr periods up to a total of 16 hr showed no evidence of toxicity. Two animals were sacrificed after a single 4-hr exposure to obtain control measures of fluroxene metabolites in tissues. Four monkeys that had previously survived received exposures to fluroxene and 3 monkeys that had no exposure to fluroxene died during fluroxene anesthesia after treatment with phenobarbital (mean time, 3 hr). Toxicity was manifested by arterial hypotension, pulmonary edema, and arterial hypoxemia. Phenobarbital treatment enhanced production of fluroxene metabolites, including the highly toxic trifluoroethanol. Concentrations of trifluoroethanol in mixed-expired gas, blood, and urine, and of total nonvolatile fluorine in blood, urine, and tissues of animals treated with phenobarbital were 2 to 10 times as in control animals. The results suggest that the rhesus monkey is a valuable model for the study of fluroxene pharmacology and that inclusion of an enzyme-inducing challenge in the evaluation of potential toxicity of other anesthetics seems warranted."

A nonadrenergic inhibitory nervous system has been demonstrated in the guinea pig trachea. Electrical field stimulation of this system, in the presence of adrenergic and cholinergic blockade, resulted in relaxation of tracheal rings contracted by the mediators of immediate hypersensitivity or histamine. The relaxation was blocked by tetrodotoxin, which indicated that nerve stimulation was responsible for the relaxation. The gastrointestinal tract, which has a similar embryological origin to the respiratory tract, also has a nonadrenergic inhibitory system. In the gastrointestinal tract, this system is thought to be responsible for the relaxation phase of peristalsis, and absence of this system, in the colon and the rectum, is thought to be an explanation for the spastic bowel in Hirschsprung's disease. It is possible that an abnormality of the respiratory nonadrenergic inhibitory system may play a role in the pathogenesis of the hyperreactive airways in asthma. The airways, due to a lack of inhibition, may be either partially contracted or unable to relax, and thus appear hyperreactive to stimuli."

    "abstract": "The effect of neonatal rat graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) on Fc receptor lymphocytes. The level  of Fc receptor rosette-forming lymphocytes (Fc-RFL) was examined in spleen and lymph node cell suspension from neonatal DA and BN rats inoculated within 24 hr of birth with either allogeneic L (experimental) or syngeneic (control) lymphoid cells. In addition, these levels were compared to fetal and neonatal animals that received no injection. The indicator cells (EA) were sheep erythrocytes sensitized with one-half concentration of the highest dilution of rabbit anti-sheep erythrocyte IgG(A) which agglutinated an equal amount of 1% suspension of E. Care was taken to exclude scoring macrophages by injecting colloidal carbon at least 1 hr before killing the test animals. The spleen of 19-day DA fetal rats exhibited a level of 19.3% Fc-RFL, similar to that of animals having received adult syngeneic cells at birth (40.0%) by day 7. Thereafter the level of Fc-RFL did not vary appreciably between these two groups. However, as early as 2 days after inoculation there was a significantly greater number of Fc-RFL in the spleen of experimental DA neonates compared to controls. The lymph nodes of experimental animals did not exhibit a significantly greater number of Fc-RFL until day 6 with both tissue compartments peaking at day 10 and remaining significantly higher than controls until death. In neonatal BN animals significantly higher levels of Fc-RFL in experimental animals were not evident as early and peaked later (day 12) in both tissue compartments but again these differences remained until death. Cytotoxic alloantisera demonstrated that on days 6, 10, and 12 most, if not all, of the Fc-RFL were host in origion in both DA and BN GVHD, with a very significant host plasma cell response in such GVHD animals. One-micron tissue section revealed the presence of a great number of plasma cell especially prominent in the medulla of lymph nodes with the cortex of lymph nodes and white pulp of the spleen markedly depleted of lymphocytes indicative of cytotoxicity."

A unique primary structure and a multiplicity of post-translational modification reactions are required for normal fibrillogenesis. The post-translational modifications include hydroxylation of prolyl and lysyl residues, glycosylation, folding of the molecule into triple-helical conformation, proteolytic conversion of precursor procollagen to collagen, and oxidative deamination of certain lysyl and hydroxylysyl residues. Any defect in the normal mechanisms responsible for the synthesis and secretion of collagen molecules or the deposition of these molecules into extracellular fibers could result in abnormal fibrillogenesis; such defects could result in a connective tissue disease.

Nonachlasine was found to increase the blood flow intensively and for long periods of time, increasing the oxygen reserve of the myocardium, thus increasing the cardiac output and the contractile function of the heart. The prevailing action of Nonachlasine on the blood supply and the function of the myocardium seems to be the result of several mechanisms: decreasing resistance of the coronaries due to the activation of the beta2-adrenergic structures; influence upon the extravascular factors of the regulation of the coronary circulation (changes in the metabolism and cardiac activity due to the excitation of the beta-adrenergic structures). The mechanism of the positive effect of Nonachlasine upon the blood supply and function of the heart is connected with its action on the adrenergic processes. The drug accumulates noradrenaline in the myocardium and increases the activity of phosphorilase-a. This coincides in time with the increased blood supply and contractile capacity of the heart. The beta-adrenoblocking agents prevent these effects. It was postulated that the effect of Nonachlasine in the blood supply and the activity of the heart is connected with its ability to utilize the energy reserve of the myocardium by way of switching over to the anaerobic way."

By animal experiments and clinically we could prove that isoglaucon instillation caused the decrease in IOP due to both increase in outflow and reduction of humor secretion; the IOP decrease and changes in hydrodynamics being manifested more markedly in the fellow-eye. As reoophthalmography demonstrated \"Isoglaucon\" produced lumen narrowing in the anterior portion of the uveal tract. \"Isoglaucon\" was prescribed to 20 patients having open-angle-glaucoma, Two hours after instillation the 23 decreased in 26 eyes (of 28) by 9.3 +/- 1.0 mm Hg. When prescribed regularly \"Isoglaucon\" raised the outflow facility coefficient from 0.10 +/- 0.01 to 0.20 +/-0.02. The secretion decreased from 2.0 +/- 0.2 to 0.9 +/- 0.15. Thus, IOP decrease after \"Isoglaucon\" is accounted for by both improved outflow and reduction of aqueous humor secretion. The \"isoglucon\" instillation produced a rather moderate decrease in the total arterial pressure, though no expected parallelism in arterial and intraocular pressure was marked."

The surgical treatment brought about in 1/3 of the cases excellent-in 1/3 good - and in 1/3 unsatisfactory results. Int the group of patients who received conservative treatment 1/3 of the cases showed excellent - 1/5 of the cases good - and 3/5 of the cases unsatisfactory results. The advantage of the surgicat treatment is that the patients are not confined to bed for long time and they must nol use walking splint releasing the hip-joint."

The activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase from freshly isolated mitochondria was shown to be dependent upon the nutritional and metabolic state of the animal prior to sacrifice, such that mitochondria from the livers of 48 hr starved, diabetic, or high fat fed rats had lower enzyme activity than normal, chow fed rats. The activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase and the rate of lipogenesis were shown to correlate to a certain extent when a reconstituted, cell free system consisting of 105,000 x g supernatant of rat liver and isolated mitochondria was used. This system was employed so that the role of the mitochondrion and pyruvate dehydrogenase in lipogenesis could be investigated. Dichloroacetate increased the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase and increased the rate of lipogenesis, suggesting that the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase is an important factor in determining the rate of lipogenesis in the reconstituted system. It was observed, however, that dichloroacetate was more effective in stimulating the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase than the rate of lipogenesis when mitochondria from starved animals were used to reconstitute lipogenesis. Furthermore, the cytoplasmic adenosine triphosphate/adenosine diphosphate ratios and phosphorylation potentials (ATP/ADP x Pi) maintained in the reconstituted system by mitochondria isolated from starved animals were found to be significantly lower than those maintained by mitochondria isolated from chow fed animals. It is proposed that the lower \"energy pressure\" maintained in the reconstituted system by mitochondria isolated from starved animals severely limits lipogenesis at the ATP requiring steps of the process."

Deterioration of the disease leading to the development of peripheral gangrene could not be prevented in spite of intensive therapy with steroids, immune suppressive agents, digitalis and antihypertensive drugs. Death 4 years later by myocardial infarction. Autopsy revealed generalized healed panarteritis nodosa with scarring and obliteration of vessels. A short description of the symptoms of the disease is given and the efficacy of the therapy with steroids and immune suppressive drugs is discussed from the clinical as well as the pathoanatomical point of view. Immunopathologic mechanisms are considered to be the responsible factors for pathogenesis."

Rapid infusion of large volumes of fluids and electrolytes, together with continuous infusion of low doses of insulin, provides effective restoration of fluid and electrolyte balance and correction of metabolic derangements. Hyperosmolar nonketotic coma is characterized by marked hyperglycemia in the absence of ketoacidosis and occurs usually in patients with mild adult-onset diabetes. Symptoms develop more slowly than in diabetic ketoacidosis. Treatment is the same for both conditions. In alcoholic ketoacidosis, hyperketonemia is present without hyperglycemia. The syndrome differs from diabetic ketoacidosis in that blood glucose levels are lower and glycosuria is absent. Treatment consists of intravenous administration of dextrose in water and, if necessary, of sodium bicarbonate. Insulin administration usually is not necessary."

As the effect of antibiotic treatment of maxillary sinusitis has been questioned, the elimination of bacteria from sinus secretions was studied during antibiotic treatment. Penicillin V, azidocillin, tetracycline or doxycycline was administered to 54 patients with maxillary sinusitis. Samples of sinus secretion were aspirated both before treatment and 2-3 days after the onset of treatment. When the antibiotic concentration was below the upper limit of MIC for sensitivity group 1, bacterial growth was present in practically all samples. When the antibiotic concentration equalled or was above this limit, there was no bacterial growth in about half of the samples. A prerequisite for antibiotic effect--elimination of bacteria--is that the antibiotic concentration is well above the MIC of the bacteria at the site of infection. The choice between bactericidal or bacteriostatic antibiotics appeared unimportant. Bacterial survival in the maxillary sinus despite a high antibiotic concentration in the sinus illustrates that MIC values determined in the laboratory do not always mirror the sensitivity of bacteria to antibiotics in vivo."

Two boys had a rotated kidney and 2 others a double renal pelvis. One boy had previously been operated upon because of hydronephrosis. There thus appears to be no reason for routine intravenous urography of cryptorchid boys. Forty-two per cent of the boys had spina bifida occulta in the lumbar and sacral spine. One case of asymptomatic congenital cardiac disease was discovered at routine chest X-ray."

The levels of carbonic anhydrase B and C isozymes in human red cells were determined using a quantitative immunological technique in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease. A significant increase in the level of carbonic anhydrase B was observed in these patients, while the level of carbonic anhydrase C did not change substantially. Positive correlations were found between the level of carbonic anhydrase B and arterial CO2 tension and plasma HCO3 concentration. A negative correlation was observed between the levels of carbonic anhydrase B and blood pH. These findings suggest that the synthesis or degradation of carbonic anhydrase B isozyme is affected by arterial CO2 tension or plasma HC03 concentration. The clinical significance was also discussed in relation to these isozyme levels in red cell."

The authors report on the drug benorylate which is available in the Federal Republic under the name of Benortan (4-acetamidophenyl-2-acetoxybenzoat). Numerous examinations have shown that it is well tolerated by mouth and that it has beneficial clinical effects with few side effects. Benorylate is a neutral, fat-soluble, water-insoluble substance which upon absorption is almost completely hydrolyzed into salicylate and paracetamol. 6 patients with classical seropositive rheumatoid arthritis and with a highly active synovialitis of one or both knee joints not previously treated received 4 g of a 40% benorylate suspension orally twice daily over a period of 9-14 days. On different days at exactly determined times of drug administration blood, and on the day of synovectomy synovial fluid and synovial tissue, were taken and frozen to - 70 degrees C and subsequently examined as to the content of salicylate, paracetamol, and unchanged benorylate. The plasma levels of salicylate and paracetamol were generally distinctly higher than the concentrations of these metabolites in the synovial fluid. Benorylate which is practically not detectable in blood is found in the synovial tissue and is detectable in greatest quantities in the most inflamed synovial villi. Benorylate can probably penetrate into the synovial membrane like its metabolites salicylate and paracetamol; it remains, however, to be examined whether the metabolites are distributed differently in different synovial areas (active inflamed and unattacked synovial tissue, respectively) in the same way as benorylate per se."

In order to study the relationship between arterial PCO2 and cerebral blood flow (CBF) in hypothermia, the body temperature of artifically ventilated rats was decreased to 22 degreesC, and changes in CBF were evaluated from arteriovenous differences in oxygen content (AVDO2) at PaCO2 values of 15, 30, 40 and 60 mm Hg. The results were compared to those obtained at normal body temperature (37 degrees C) over the PaCO2 range 15-60 mm Hg. Separate experiments were performed to evaluate CBF and CMRO2 at 22 degrees C and a PaCO2 of 15 mm Hg, using an inert gas technique for CBF. The tissue contents of phosphocreatine, ATP, ADP, AMP and lactate were measured in hypothermic animals at PaCO2 values of 15, 30 and 60 mm Hg. The results showed that changes in CBF were of the same relative magnitude in hypothermia and normothermia when PaCO2 was increased from about 35 to about 60 mm Hg. However, with a decrease in PaCO2 the reduction in CBF was much more pronounced in hypothermia, and at PaCO2 15 Mm Hg CBF was less then 20% of the value measured in normothermic and normocapnic animals. The results of the metabolite measurements gave no evidence of tissue hypoxia in spite of the pronounced reduction in CBF. Although the results demonstrate that the brain of a hypothermic animal is protected against the harmful effects of a lowered CBF, it may not warrant recommending hyperventilation in clinical cases of hypothermia, especially not in patients with arteriosclerosis or cerebrovascular diseases."

Eight patients had cardiac manifestations that were life-threatening in five while taking psychotropic drugs, either phenothiazines or tricyclic antidepressants. Although most patients were receiving several drugs, Mellaril (thioridazine) appeared to be responsible for five cases of ventricular tachycardia, one of which was fatal in a 35 year old woman. Supraventricular tachycardia developed in one patient receiving Thorazine (chlorpromazine). Aventyl (nortriptyline) and Elavil (amitriptyline) each produced left bundle branch block in a 73 year old woman. Electrocardiographic T and U wave abnormalities were present in most patients. The ventricular arrhythmias responded to intravenous administration of lidocaine and to direct current electric shock; ventricular pacing was required in some instances and intravenous administration of propranolol combined with ventricular pacing in one. The tachyarrhythmias generally subsided within 48 hours after administration of the drugs was stopped. Five of the eight patients were 50 years of age or younger; only one clearly had antecedent heart disease. Major cardiac arrhythmias are a potential hazard in patients without heart disease who are receiving customary therapeutic doses of psychotropic drugs. A prospective clinical trial is suggested to quantify the risk of cardiac complications to patients receiving phenothiazines or tricyclic antidepressant drugs."

The partial pressure of oxygen rose significantly in the majority of cases, and the alveolo-arterial gradient also significantly diminished by more than 100 mm of mercury. 29 children were treated by this method alone, but in 20 other children owing to the failure of constant negative pressure, respiratory assistance either by intermittent pressure ventilation or intermittent positive pressure ventilation was associated.

Continuous negative pressure seems to be a safe and effective method for improving oxygenation in the idiopathic respiratory distress syndrome."

Progress in neanatal shock reveals facts already known in the adult and in experimental medicine: concept of preferential and circulatory by-pass. A considerable decrease in blood flow is seen in the latter during shock; this shock is sometimes not important. Mesenteric circulation is the best example. This syndrome should therefore be included in the major vascular changes of neonatal period. Vascular and infectious enteropathy is a broader term which seems more appropriate because of aetiological and therapeutic implications. The aetiology should be considered as a sum of several factors varying from one patient to another (multifactorial disease). The circulatory component remains very important. Its severity depends on whether or not it is treated. Four notions should be defined: -- Census of population of subjects with \"high risk\" of vascular and infectious enteropathy (score trial); -- Isolation of clinical pictures corresponding to a medical or surgical stage; Grouping of elements for immediate and long term prognosis; -- Grouping of elements for immediate and long term prognosis; -- Proposal of preventive treatment to the \"high risk\" patients (surgery; continuons parenteral and enteral feeding are intientionally left out in this paper).

Characteristically, they are ischaemic and their anatomical and histological progress is rapid: coagulation necrosis with rapid axonal fragmentation followed by polymorphic cellular reaction with glial cells and macrophages. Regeneration in the minor forms consists of glyosis process in severe forms; multiple cavities appear in a few weeks. Physiopathogenic hypotheses put forward are related to: 1 -- the very anatomic aite: special tissue and terminal arteries, 2 -- onset of myelinization process, 3 -- associated clinical and biological lesions such as hypoxia, acidosis and hypotention. These lesions are symptom-free during the neonatal period. One of us suggested in 1962 that these could be the anatomical basis of spastic monoplegia or diplegia (LITTLE's disease). All motor cerebral sequelae have disappeared since 10 years. This is particularly significant mainly in the case of spastic diplegia of the former premature baby under 2500 g. This decrease coincides with improvement in neonatal care, especially correction of hypoxia, acidosis and cardiovascular collapse. These findings seem to support the pathogenic hypotheses."

Consideration is given to progestational agents, oxytocics, beta-mimetics, corticosteroids, insulin, hypotensive agents, diuretics and psychiatric drugs. For each case of interference, an attempt is made to provide practical data, with particular respect to those combinations frequently prescribed by obstetricians, e.g. the combination of the beta-mimetics and corticosteroids with the aim of preventing impending premature onset of labour and to ensure foetal pulmonary maturation; the combination of insulin and corticosteroids given to diabetics with the aim of preventing hyaline membrane disease; the combination of corticosteroids with anti-histamines in the treatment of rhesus disease; the association of oxytocics with large quantities of intravenous fluid in the case of post-partum haemorrhage and hypontensive medication combinations and the problems which may result with emergency anaesthesis."

The study of 16 newborn of birthweight less than or equal to 2,200 g characterized by a common point: the presence of PLACENTA PRAEVIA IN THE MOTHER, enabled us to come to grips with the severe respiratory distress that these newborn can have. From the clinical standpoint: there is always early respiratory distress. From the radiological standpoint: by far the most dominant pathology was interstitial edema, giving rise to a WET LUNG. From the biochemical standpoint: the blood gases were characterized in a certain number of cases by hypoxemia which was refractory to the usual forms of treatment. From the mechanical standpoint: measurements carried out in 4 patients confirmed the extraordinary fall in these patients' compliance. The clinical, radiological, blood gas and mechanical analysis enabled one to differenciate 2 main types of indications for artificial ventilation: -- acute hypoxemia, -- the idea of an increased need for oxygen. In these 2 types of indications for artificial ventilation, it was apparent that the treatment of choice is constant positive pressure which may or may not be combined with intermittent positive pressure. With this treatment technique, none of the patients progressed to massive atelectasis. It can be said that with the advent of techniques of ventilation by high pressure combining IPP with CPP, one has definitively eliminated from this pathological picture, the principal cause of death: --anoxia due to massive alveolar collapse."

The effects of the cardioselective beta-blocker, metoprolol, were evaluated under double-blind conditions in eighteen patients with angina pectoris. During an introductory run-in period of eight weeks, a placebo was given single-blindly. Thereafter two double-blind crossover periods each of four weeks followed, either 20 mg metroprolol or placebo being given t.i.d. Metoprolol gave a significant reduction in the number of anginal attacks and in nitroglycerin consumption. The patients' subjective assessments of their daily angina pectoris symptoms also showed a significant improvement compared with the placebo. At the end of each period, a standardized exercise test was performed. In comparison with placebo, metoprolol gave a significant increase of total work performed until the appearance of 1 mm ST-segment depression and until the end of exercise. The heart rate was significantly reduced at rest and during exercise. The blood pressure was significantly reduced only during exercise. None of the patients reported any severe unwanted effects. The complaints reported were mild to moderate, and the frequency during metoprolol treatment was even lower than during placebo treatment. No signs or symptoms of cardiac failure were seen in any of these patients on any occasion. It is concluded that 20 mg metoprolol t.i.d. is of benefit in the treatment of angina pectoris but further benefit might be obtained with higher doses."

Our results indicate that, in the management of pyelonephritis complicating preexisting renal disease, if the minimal inhibitory gentamicin concentration for an infecting organism is greater than the usual therapeutic an nontoxic serum levels of the compound, then it may be appropriate to use alternate antibiotics that demonstrate lesser reduction in tissue drug accumulation in diseased kidneys."

Like the o-toluidine method, this method is based on a general carbohydrate reaction except that it occurs in a mildly alkaline medium and the intense yellow color formed is measured at 400 nm. Advantages of this reagent over o-toluidine include lower cost, less toxicity, and higher purity.

Plasma of insulin-treated diabetics and of newborn infants of insulin-treated diabetic mothers contains insulin antibodies which invalidates the radioimmunoassay of insulin. Therefore, the endogenous insulin antibody complex must be splitted at a pH lower than 5 and the total IRI (TIRI) is separated by ethanol extraction. It was investigated the recovery rate in dependence upon plasma volume used for extraction. By reduction of used plasma volume from 500 to 200 mul per extraction the recovery rate was increased from 65.1 +/- 8.4 to 88.3 +/- 4.2% (mean +/- SEM). The low plasma volume of 200 mul for TIRI extraction made it possible to determine TIRI during glucose loads of newborn infants. To eliminate different conditions of incubation for standard and unknown plasma samples the TIRI levels were computed by means of so-called \"extracted\" standard curve, obtained with extracted insulin from standard insulin dilution in insulin-free pooled human plasma. Using the described method a temporary regeneration of insulin secretion of a newly diagnosed juvenile diabetic after insulin treatment could be shown. In contrast to newborn infants of healthy mothers a biphasic/insulin release was found during the intravenous glucose loads in newborn infants of insulin-treated diabetic mothers."

Baseline and stimulated levels of testosterone, androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone were similar in patients with unilateral cryptorchidism, monorchism and hypospadias; baseline and stimulated levels of testosterone were lower in boys with bilateral cryptorchidism. Testosterone levels did not correlate with either the anatomical location of the testis in patients with unilateral cryptorchidism or with the site of the urethra in boys with hypospadias. Seven of 36 patients with cryptorchidism had a positive family history of a similar disorder; testosterone levels were similar in patients with and without a family history. It is concluded: 1) in all patients studied, the gonadotropin dependent phase of testosterone production is present; 2) hCG stimulation cannot detect unilateral Leydig cell dysfunction; and 3) in familial cases of cryptorchidism, some factor other than an abnormality in androgen synthesis may be responsible for the hereditary tendency."

Hemin allows maximal protein synthesis in intact rabbit reticulocytes and their cell-free lysate preparations by retarding the formation of a translational repressor (HCR) found in the postribosomal supernate. In order to evaluate the role of HCR in the pathogenesis of hypochromic anemias, HCR was isolated and partially purified from intact rabbit reticulocytes incubated in vitro with either 0.1 mM alpha,alpha-dipyridyl (an iron-chelating agent) or 0.1 M ethanol. Both of these agents inhibit reticulocyte protein synthesis. Hemin (50 muM) protects against the inhibition by both agents. A ferrous iron-transferrin mixture, however, protects only against alpha,alpha-dipyridyl. Both alpha,alpha-dipyridyl and ethanol inhibit heme synthesis before the time that protein synthesis is affected, while neither lowers either ATP or GSH levels. These results indicate that while both agents inhibit heme synthesis, alpha,alpha-dipyridyl does so by inducing iron deficiency while ethanol works at a non-iron-requiring step. When HCR was isolated from intact cells and assayed in the reticulocyte cell-free systems, plus and minus hemin, premature appearance of HCR was found in cells incubated in vitro with alpha,alpha-dipyridyl or ethanol. When hemin was present in the intact cell incubation, the appearance of HCR was retarded. The HCR from alpha,alpha-dipyridyl ethanol-treated cells was partially purified and eluted at the same location on a Sephadex G-200 column (molecular weight approximately 3 x 10(5)) as that from postribosomal supernates incubated minus hemin. In addition rabbits with phenylhydrazine-induced hemolytic anemia were given intravenous ethanol in vivo at a dose of 0.4 ml/kg. This concentration of alcohol resulted in an inhibition of the rate of heme synthesis and protein synthesis as well as an acceleration of HCR formation in reticulocytes. The HCR from these in vivo treated rabbits was isolated, partially purified, and assayed in an identical fashion as the in vitro experiments. These in vivo experiments further support the physiological and pathophysiological role of HCR in reticulocytes. On the basis of these results a model for a role of HCR in some of the hypochromic anemias is proposed. In iron deficiency or chronic disease (where iron is not available to the erythroblast for heme synthesis) HCR appears prematurely and inhibits protein synthesis.

The findings suggest that pneumococcal infection was present in 44% of 300 unselected suspected chest infections. Culture for pneumococci was positive in only 15% of these cases. The clinical importance of these findings is still being studied but our experience has shown that patients with chest infections should have effective antipneumococcal antibiotics as part of their regimen and that the laboratory diagnosis may be made quickly and accurately by counter-current immunoelectrophoresis."

The LD50 for mice subjected to smoke was 45 mg/kg of histamine, whereas in normal CFW mice the LD50 was 1,100 mg/kg. The histamine susceptibility of smoked mice was markedly diminished by injecting the animals with isoproterenol. Normal CFW mice, as well as sham control mice, exhibited an epinephrine-induced hyperglycemia, whereas the blood glucose values for smoked mice given epinephrine were essentially the same as those for sham mice given only saline. This observation indicates that tobacco smoke may contain a component which causes an autonomic imbalance, hence rendering the mice more susceptible to histamine. This tobacco smoke-induced allergy is probably related to a blockade of adrenergic receptors and not to an immunologic phenomenon."

Each of 41 patients with bacterial pneumonia was placed into 1 of 4 categories based on the relative clinical certainty of the diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumonia. The frequency of pneumococcal polysaccharide in the sputum by counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIE) was then noted for each diagnostic category of patients. Detection of pneumococcal polysaccharide in sputum correlated with the diagnostic certainty of pneumococcal pneumonia, while results of culture of sputum were less indicative of pneumococcal infection. Saliva of 83 normal individuals failed to give positive tests for pneumococcal polysaccharide despite the presence of alpha-hemolytic streptococci on culture. Furthermore, the mere presence of pneumococci in cultures did not predict a positive test for polysaccharide by CIE nor did the absence of pneumococci mean that polysaccharide would not be detected.

It is concluded that spontaneous lactic acidosis can be produced in diabetic, but not in normal, rabbits by infusion of beta-hydroxybutric acid followed by infusion of NaHCO3."

Therefore, we investigated the antisecretory effects of a new H2-receptor antagonist, cimetidine, in 200-, 300- or 400-mg doses, taken orally at bedtime. The 200-mg dose did not cause a statistically significant change in nocturnal (midnight to 7 a.m.) acid output and had only a borderline effect on pH. However, the 300-mg and 400-mg doses significantly (P less than 0.001) lowered acid output and increased (P less than 0.01) intragastric pH. All doses caused substantial decreases in secretory volume output. After a 400-mg dose, half the patients remained anacidic for eight hours. Dose-related increases of drug blood levels were observed and correlated with the degree and duration of inhibition of acid output. Serum gastrin levels were unaffected. Cimetidine appears to be a potent inhibitor of nocturnal gastric secretion."

A survey of polyarteritis nodosa in domestic animals is presented, including a description of the patho-morphological lesions and a discussion on the causal factors. This vascular disease occurs in domestic animals in association with both viral infections (infectious plasmacytosis in mink), bacterial infections (erysipelas in swine), and protozoan infections (nosematosis in blue foxes). The conclusion is drawn that the observations in domestic animals support the view that immunological disturbances are involved as pathogenetic mechanisms. Nosematosis is dealt with in more detail; the infecting agent (fig. 1), Nosema cuniculi (Encephalitozoon cuniculi), is a widespread mamalian parasite, which causes cerebral and renal lesions in blue foxes of the same type as in animals of other species. In addition, the vascular system throughout the body is affected, resulting in patho-morphological alterations corresponding to classical polyarteritis nodosa (Fig. 2).

The diagnostic and prognostic reliability of lipoprotein-X (Lp-X) in demonstrating or ruling out cholestasis has been evaluated in a group of 80 patients with diseases of the liver and/or the biliary tracts, and in 103 subjects with various other diseases. The results of Lp-X detection were compared with the so-called \"enzymes indicating cholestasis\": alkaline phosphatase, leucine arylamidase, and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase. Where possible a histologic specimen of the liver was obtained. The correlation between Lp-X and \"enzymes indicating cholestasis\" was satisfactory in more than 90% of cases. When compared with the histologic findings, Lp-X proved to be more reliable than the enzymes. Despite this fact, Lp-X did not show absolute specifity in the detection of cholestasis as there were several negative results in cases with histologically proven cholestasis. Furthermore, the differentiation of intra- and extrahepatic cholestasis was not possible on the basis of Lp-X. In the control group of 103 patients with other than hepatobiliary diseases, a positive Lp-X result was found in 3 cases. Further investigations in these three patients revealed that primarily unsuspected hepatobiliary disease could not be ruled out. In the follow-up of a hepatobiliary disease the transition of Lp-X to negative indicates a trend towards improvement of cholestasis 1-2 weeks earlier than the enzymes mentioned above."

Lysolecithin was isolated and identified from the gastric contents of 5 patients with gastric ulcer and erosive and atrophic gastritis. The methods used involved methanolic extration, column chromatography on silica gel and sephadex gel filtration, followed by preparative thin layer chromatography. Identification of lysolecithin was verified in one sample by thin layer chromatography and elementary analysis. A method for quantitation of lysolecithin in human gastric fluid for routine clinical analysis is described, based on the procedure used for identification of this phospholipid. Further, a hemolysis test is proposed for screening gastric contents for lysolecithin concentrations above approximately 10 mg/100 ml. With the quantitative method, an average concentration of 66.1 mg of lysolecithin in 100 ml gastric content was found in the group of 5 patients. The screening test was positive in all 5 samples, but was negative with native gastric juice in 25 persons serving as controls. When the gastric fluid of the controls was concentrated, however, 9 samples gave a positive hemolytic reaction. From these 9 specimens, the lysolecithin concentration was found to average 0.9 mg/100 ml. These findings afford evidence that lysolecithin may be involved as a factor in the pathogenesis of gastric ulceration."

It was found that enterobacteria in the viscera of the diseased birds were three to nine times more frequently encountered than in the same organs of the controls. In two cases Salmonella bacteria were also isolated from the affected chickens. In three cases there were enterobacteria in the red musculature of these birds. The meat of the diseased birds had higher water content, higher catalase number and pH value, with lower contents of proteins, fats, and mineral matter.

The single most characteristic morphological feature in I-cell disease (ICD) is the accumulation of membrane-bound vacuoles in mesenchymal cells (mainly fibroblasts). No true storage can be documented in those vacuoles. That their contents could have been dissolved during fixation or embedding remains however a possibility. Remnants consisting of a few lamellar arrays and of small amounts of fibrillo-granular material are too scarce for histochemical characterization. In hepatocytes large cells in the white pulp of the spleen and in myocardial fibers, vacuoles with fixative insoluble contents have been discovered; they are nowhere very abundant and their specificity is questionable. Because the affected fibroblastic elements represent a small fraction in any organ, most secondary biochemical abnormalities are expected to be detectable only in purely fibroblastic tissues. Our pathological study contributes to the understanding of some of the clinical features characteristic of ICD and stresses major morphological differences between ICD and the many diseases classified as mucopolysaccharidoses and mucolipidoses."

Despite this fact, the anxiolitic effect of Lorazepam and its anti-allergic consequences were conclusive. A parallel study using only placebo treatment, orally and by vaccine, was performed in a few cases. 39 patients out of 45 treated by Temesta and placebo vaccine, had few or very few allergic symptoms.

Three cases of Wegener's granulomatosis with a classical course are described, 2 of which with fatal outcome in spite of immuno-suppressive therapy. Nephroangiography was performed during the oliguric or anuric phase. The appearances were similar to those encountered in glomerulonephritis and were compared with those in three cases of panarteritis nodosa. Two of these represented the classical form with intrarenal arterial aneurysms; the third was a case of the microscopic type presenting blurred intrarenal arteries with lumen variations and occlusions. These observations support the opinion that Wegener's granulomatosis nodosa are different diseases. Nephroangiography seems to be of value in their differentiation."

Little overlap exists between these conditions, and that which is present can be explained on the basis of two mutually exclusive factors: (1) the secondary consequences of hormone excess on another endocrine gland or (2) the fact that both tumor syndromes appear to result from genetically faulty differentiation of neuroectoderm. A seemingly disproportionate amount of effort has been expended on study of the MEA syndromes. However, there would seen to be ample justification for this interest: 1) The MEA syndromes, unlike most neoplastic conditions, are hereditary and can be readily detected and more expeditiously treated; 2) hormone radioimmunoassay has greatly facilitated diagnosis in asymptomatic individuals; and (3) probably most importantly, study of these syndromes has provided considerable insight into the embryologic origin of the endocrine system. It is conceivable that knowledge gained from these conditions may stimulate further inquiry into the processes whereby neoplasia occurs in endocrine tissue and thus lead the way to the development of effective therapy for a host of hormone-producing tumors."

All enzyme levels in diseased synovium except esterase values in osteoarthritis were significantly elevated compared with controls. The mean values of the group of acid hydrolases and the group of neutral and alkaline hydrolases in osteoarthritic synovia were 1.9- and 2.0-fold greater than those of control specimens. In rheumatoid synovia, the values were 4.2- and 4.5 fold greater than control for the same enzymes. Levels in rheumatoid synovia were significantly higher than those in osteoarthritic synovia with the exception of 5'-nucleotidase. Only a limited correlation between the extents of inflammation present in the synovia and the levels of a lysosomal marker enzyme (cathepsin D) was observed. These results demonstrate that whatever the mechanism, increased levels of acid hydrolases as well as certain neutral and alkaline hydrolases are present in osteoarthritic and rheumatoid synovia, and these enzymes are probably contained in the synovial lining cells."

Until 1972, Kawasaki disease, or acute febrile infantile mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome (MCLS), was considered in Japan to be a nonfatal disease with a favorable prognosis. Based on the findings from two autopsy cases of MCLS, we believe that sudden and unexpected death during convalescence may be due to arterial lesions, especially those involving the coronary artery, that resemble those of periarteritis nodosa. Of 29 autopsy cases of MCLS, gathered from all over Japan, all exhibited arteritis lesions (eg, aneurysm due to coronary arteritis). Such vascular pathological findings may in fact represent the same entity as infantile periarteritis nodosa. Whether infantile periarteritis nodosa can be identified with the adult type is still debatable. The particular manifestations of infantile periarteritis nodosa might be related to severe vasculitis. Autopsy cases of infantile periarteritis nodosa without MCLS manifestations are being collected and studied."

These effects do not appear to be due to the 4-amino-7-chloroquinoline structure from which glafenine is derived, as they are not observed with the structural analogue chloroquine given at equimolar doses under the same conditions. Further, they do not appear to be due to glycerol, the by-product of metabolic glafenine hydrolysis. The responsible molecule appears to be either glafenine itself or its acid metabolite 4-(0-carboxyphenylamino) 7-chloroquinoline."

In order to mimic the clinical situation more closely, a further crossover study was undertaken using Ethchlorvynol 300 mg/kg alone and the same dose followed by castor oil 15 ml/kg repeated q12h. This showed no delay in reaching peak serum concentration and no reduction of peak levels. However, it did show a 31 per cent reduction in the half-life of the drug.

However, important trends and some significant results were observed with the lower doses of PLG. These essentially negative results may be attributed to poor intestinal absorption of the compound, a short biologic half-life in the blood, or administration of oral doses that were much higher than required, or a combination of factors. In further studies with this peptide, which are encouraged, the intravenous route should be used until the question of intestinal absorption is resolved."

In 1 of 133 patients the sepsis was due to Gram-positive organisms, and in 1 of 188 patients to Gram-negative organisms. The mortality rate for Gram-positive cases was 4.4 percent, for Gram-negative cases 19.1 percent, and for urologic cases 15.3 percent (versus 56.25 percent in 1959-1964). Data are presented on the relative incidences of involved pathogens in 1740 cases of Gram-positive sepsis /78 deaths), and in 1236 cases of Gram-negative sepsis (205 deaths). The lowering of the sepsis mortality rate has been the result of preventative measures, early diagnosis, and vigorous treatment. Treatment includes the correction of acidosis and anoxia, early administration of bactericidal antibiotics, and restoration of the microcirculation by administration of corticosteroids, beta-adrenergic drugs, and appropriate diuretics."

Mosquitoes (eggs, larvae, and adults), small woodland animals, and residents of an area where California encephalitis is endemic were studied to elucidate the host-vector cycle of La Crosse virus. Elementary schoolchildren from surrounding communities and gray squirrels from another area were tested to compare the prevelence of serum antibodies to La Crosse virus in areas where the disease is endemic with the prevalence of these antibodies in areas where the disease is not endemic. From 1971 to 1974, eight isolations of La Crosse virus were made. Three of the isolates were from adult mosquitoes, one from Aedes triseriatus eggs, and four from A. triseriatus larvae. The isolation of virus from field-collected eggs and larvae confirms previous studies from Wisconsin that suggest that La Crosse virus overwinters in eggs of the mosquite A. triseriatus. In an area where California encephalitis is endemic, 10 of 19 small woodland animals (53%), which are the natural hosts of A. triseriatus, had hemagglutination-inhibiting and neutralizing antibodies to La Crosse virus. In contrast, none of 10 squirrels from an area where the disease is not endemic had such antibodies. Fourteen of 79 residents of this area (17.7%) had both types of antibody. Eleven of the 14 seropositive residents lived in one small sector of the community studied, an indication that foci of La Crosse virus activity may be very localized. Elementary schoolchildren from surrounding communitites had a significantly lower prevalence of hemagglutination-inhibiting antibody to La Crosse virus than did the residents of the area where California encephalitis was endemic."

Medical histories were obtained from routine service records. Undescended testis was associated with a testicular cancer risk 8.8 times that of normal. Among cancer patients with a history of undescended testis, seminomas were nearly twice as frequent as in the remaining patients. Of 14 patients with unilateral undescended testis, 12 had the tumor on the side of the defect. Testicular cancer risk was estimated to be 2.9 times higher in men who had reported having had an inguinal hernia than in those who had not. Side of hernia and side of tumor were not associated; histologic type was not related to history of hernia."

No functional immunologic improvement occurred in the first infant, who died of pulmonary disease 10 months later. Clinical and functional immunologic improvement occurred in the other, who is now 19 months after transplantation. Lymphocyte responses to phytohemagglutinin and pokeweed mitogen were noted by three months, to concanavalin A by five months, and to allogeneic cells by eight months. Delayed cutaneous responsiveness to candida developed and IgM became norma. IgA and IgG remained low. Chimerism was demonstrated by a donor marker chromosome in metaphases from recipient lymphocytes. Fetal liver cells therefore reversed the immunodeficiency."

Combined prostaglandin and histamine blockade further attenuated, but again did not abolish, the pulmonary vascular responses. Cardiac outputs and systemic arterial pressures were unchanged from control by embolism. The alveolar hypoventilation (decreased arterial oxygen tension and increased carbon dioxide tension) observed in the untreated embolized dogs was prevented only with the prostaglandin inhibitors. Pulmonary microembolism in intact dogs, therefore, appears to induce vasoconstriction mediated partially by prostaglandin and histamine action, and alveolar hypoventilation mediated by prostaglandin, but not histamine, action."

The interaction between cedilanid-D and metoprolol, a selective beta receptor blocking agent, on exercise tolerance and systolic intervals was studied in 15 patients with angina pectoris. The patients had been treated with metoprolol for several months in a dose of 50 mg, three times daily (one patient received 25 mg three times daily). Each patient participated in two studies separated by at least 1 week. After arriving at the laboratory each received 50 mg of metoprolol orally; thereafter, either cedilanid-D or placebo was infused intravenously in a double-blind study performed in randomized order. When the effect of the drugs was maximal, the systolic intervals and the heart volume were recorded at rest, and the exercise tolerance was tested with a bicycle ergometer. The mean maximal value of plasma concentrations of metoprolol assessed during the study was about 50 ng/ml but the variation among subjects was great (20 to 187 ng/ml). After administration of cedilanid-D there was a shortening of the pre-ejection period and left ventricular ejection time compared with results after placebo; the reduction was similar to that found after administration  of cedilanid-D without beta blocking drugs. The total heart volume decreased by an average of 55 ml, but the individual variation was great. The patients' average work capacity, expressed as total work, was not altered by cedilanid-D when compared with results after placebo. No relation was found between initial heart size and the effect of cedilanid-D on capacity for physical work.

The first patient had a distal acidifying defect. Circumstantial evidence has been presented suggesting that exposure to toluene-diisocyanate or toluene-diamine played a role in the pathogenesis. The acidosis and the hypokalemia of this patient were easily corrected by the administration of small amounts of sodium bicarbonate without potassium supplementation. The second patient had an interstitial nephritis of unknown etiology and presented with moderate renal insufficiency, renal tubular acidosis, and proximal as well as distal acidifying defects. The proximal tubular dysfunction was associated with general aminoaciduria and glucosuria. This patient required large quantities of both alkali and potassium to correct the electrolyte abnormalities. The mechanisms of potassium wasting in proximal and distal renal tubular acidosis are reviewed. A classification is presented of cellular defects that may underlie the different renal acidifying defects. Attempts to distinguish between pump and permeability defects from urinary pCO2 levels must take into account the simultaneous HCO-3 concentration, since large pCO2 elevations require the presence of ample HCO-3 in the urine. Permeability defects may impair urinary acidification by either abnormal back flux of H+ out of the lumen or increased influx of HCO-3 into the lumen. In studies of acidification in vitro, amphotericin B causes increased H+ permeability and has little effect on HCO-3 permeability. Toluene-diamine causes a marked permeability defect which is reversible, but remains to be defined in terms of the ion species, HCO-3 or H+, affected. At times, hyperchloremic acidosis is caused by distal defects in net acid excretion that occur without impairment of the H+ gradient. In certain patients with hypoaldosteronism, for example, distal H+ secretion may be reduced without change in the force of the H+ pump."

An enzymic utilization of O-acetyl-l-carnitine via hydrolysis of the ester bond to yield stoicheiometric quantities of acetate and l-carnitine was demonstrated; 0.55, 0.53 and 0.30mumol of acetyl-l-carnitine were utilized/min per g fresh wt. of liver homogenates from rats, sheep and dry cows respectively. 3. The acetylcarnitine hydrolysis activity was not due to a non-specific esterase or non-specific cholinesterase. O-Acetyl-d-carnitine was not utilized. 4. The activity was associated with the enriched outer mitochondrial membrane fraction from rat liver. Isolation of this fraction resulted in an eightfold purification of acetylcarnitine hydrolase activity. 4. The K(m) for this acetylcarnitine utilization was 2mm and 1.5mm for rat and sheep liver homogenates respectively. 6. There was a significant increase in acetylcarnitine hydrolase in rats on starvation and cows on lactation and a significant decrease in sheep that were severely alloxan-diabetic. 7. The physiological role of an acetylcarnitine hydrolase is discussed in relation to coupling with carnitine acetyltransferase for the relief of ;acetyl pressure'."

Metroprolol was compared with placebo at two dose levels (20 mg t.d.s. and 50 mg t.d.s.) in a double-blind trial in 14 patients. Compared with placebo, metroprolol caused a significant reduction of heart rate and systolic blood pressure during exercise, and consequently a reduction of the rate-pressure product. The reduction was greater with 50 mg t.d.s. than with 20 mg t.d.s. The exercise tolerance measured as total work increased significantly by 21 per cent during treatment with metroprolol 20 mg t.d.s., and by 17 per cent during treatment with 50 mg t.d.s. There was a reduction in the number of anginal attacks and in nitroglycerin consumption, and subjective improvement of angina pectoris at both dose levels of metroprolol. No signs of cardiac failure appeared during any of the four treatment periods. Heart volume showed no significant change.

Four major forms of alpha-fucosidase (EC 3.2.1.51) activity were separated by isoelectrofocusing from sera of normal control individuals. All forms shifted towards less acidic pI values after neuraminidase treatment. In two patients affected with fucosidosis, only a single major acidic peak was observed and this was affected to a lesser degree by neuraminidase treatment. The kinetics of heat inactivation of the residual activity found in these two patients showed two decay rates while the controls showed only one rate. These data are considered in relation to the hypothesis of the existence of interconvertible thermolabile and thermostable forms of the enzyme which has been discussed in the preceeding paper. The residual alpha-fucosidase found in patients could be structurally altered so that its ability to form the thermostable higher molecular weight aggregates is impaired."

Human marrow transplantation has resulted in observations of fundamental significance in understanding both aplastic anemia and acute leukemia. For example, the observation that transplanted marrow can grow successfully in patients with aplastic anemia indicates that the disease is due to a defect in the marrow precursor cells and not in the marrow microenvironment. Similarly, the observation of recurrent leukemia in donor cells has important implications. Nonetheless, marrow transplantation is sufficiently established therapeutically to be considered the treatment of choice for patients with severe aplastic anemia, and a realistic alternative for patients with recurrent acute leukemia. We suggest that patients be managed with regard to marrow transplantation according to the general approach outlined in Table 3. Marrow transplantation and histocompatibility typing are available at increasing numbers of institutions throughout the world. More and more patients with either severe aplastic anemia or recurrent acute leukemia should have marrow transplantation available to them when it is indicated as part of optimal management of these no longer hopeless diseases."

A sensitive assay for d-3hydroxybutrate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.30) was developed for use with the minute amounts of material obtained from islets of Langerhans microdissected from freeze-dried pancreatic sections. NADH formed in the enzyme reaction was determined by photokinetic analysis of the luminescence obtained with bacterial luciferase from Achromobacter fishcherii. In this way, accurate determination was obtained with less than 0.1 mug dry weight of islet material. In obese hyperglycemic mice, the islet enzyme had an activity of 4.7 mumoles/min and g dry weight. Optimal enzyme activity was found at pH 8 for the islet enzyme. The enzyme activity was similar in pancreatic islets and acini, while considerably higher activity was found in cardiac muscle, liver and renal cortex. Normal mouse islets showed about equal enzyme activity as the islets from obese hyperglycemic mice."

These include Venezuelan encephalitis (VE), eastern encephalitis (EE) and western encephalitis (WE), which are found in the Americas, and Japanese B encephalitis which occurs in the Far East. All the viruses cause encephalitis in man. Between 1969 and 1972 an epidemic of VE occurred in Central America. In 1971 the disease was reported in Texas, where it was brought under control by the vaccination of susceptible horses with an attenuated live virus vaccine and by the reduction of the mosquito population with insecticides sprayed from aircraft. A high titre viraemia occurs with VE virus in the horse and epidemics are maintained by a mosquito/horse cycle; infection of man and other species is incidental. EE and WE have been recognised as separate diseases since 1933 and in the U.S.A. horses are protected by routine vaccination. Epidemics of these diseases are routine vaccination. Epidemics of these diseases are now uncommon. In contrast with VE, both EE and WE viruses are maintained by a bird/mosquito cycle. The viraemia in the horse is generally considered insufficient to infect mosquito vectors; the horse is a \"dead end host\". Several species of mosquito can act as vectors of VE, WE and EE. The extension of other arthropod-borne diseases to areas originally outside their geographical distribution (e.g. bluetongue in sheep) serves to illustrate the potential of VE, WE and EE to cause disease on other continents."

Parenteral and oral application of kallikrein (EC 3.4.21.8)--a kinin-releasing proteinase from porcine pancreatic tissue--significantly stimulates quantitative and qualitative sperm motility in subfertile males with semen criteria of asthenozoospermia. Improvement of sperm motility was found to exist for at least 3 months following termination of the 7 week duration kallikrein treatment. Additionally, a significant increase in the number of spermatozoa was observed 3 and 5 months after starting parenteral application of kallikrein."

Neurotransmitter-receptor binding sites for apparent muscarinic cholinergic, beta-adrenergic, gamma-aminobutyric acid and serotonin receptors were measured in the caudate nucleus and frontal cerebral cortex from post-mortem brains of 16 patients with Huntington's chorea and 16 controls. In addition, the samples were assayed for the gamma-aminobutyric-acid-synthesizing enzyme, glutamic acid decarboxylase, and for the acetylcholine-synthesizing enzyme, choline acetyltransferase. In the caudate nucleus of choreic brain, both enzyme activities were markedly lower, with significant decreases in muscarinic cholinergic and serotonin receptor binding, whereas enzyme activities and receptor binding were unchanged in the cerebral cortex. By contrast, gamma-aminobutyric acid and beta-adrenergic receptor binding were not significantly different in choreic and control caudate nucleus or cortex, suggesting that, despite the loss of gamma-aminobutyric-acid-synthesizing ability in the corpus striatum, gamma-aminobuytric acid mimetic drugs might alleviate the movement disorders in Huntington's chorea."

In all cases, a history should be obtained quickly, the patient should be examined to confirm the diagnosis, and epinephrine should be administered. Hospitalization is indicated in severe cases with systemic symptoms. Once the acute episode has been treated, the physician must decide whether further investigation is necessary. Quite often a presumptive etiologic diagnosis is made on the basis of the history. Allergy testing is not part of the routine evaluation of the patient with urticaria."

The Conference was attended by specialists taking care of the child with cerebral palsy (C.P.): child neurologists, surgeons--orthopedists, psychologists, rehabilitants, pediatricians. In connection with the fact that the Conference was devoted to the early diagnosis and therapy of C.P., problems concerning the lower age groups of children were debated. The Conference discussed the definitions of \"cerebral palsy\" used in the literature, the clinical forms, the auxiliary diagnostic methods and their significance in the diagnosing of this pathological syndrome. Early clinical symptoms, enabling to establish the diagnosis of cerebral palsy were particularly extensively debated. In the latter problem particular attention was paid to the diagnostic value of kinetic automatisms of the group of tonic posture reflexes and dysfunctions of the kinetic pattern in children. It was underlined in the debate the C.P. was no separate clinical disease, but a pathological syndrome arisen as a result of the negative influence of different factors and yielding very diverse clinical and neurolopathologic symptoms, according to the kind of noxious factors and the period and degree of maturity of the nervous system in which they acted. The participants in the debate also sressed that, as the child develops and is observed for a longer period it is fairly often necessary to check this diagnosis, as C.P. may prove, as the time passes, to be a degenerative syndrome, a pressure syndrome etc. The psychologists participating in the Conference discussed the psychological problems of the child with C.P. and also the early diagnosis of the pathological syndrome debated. The diversity of the symptoms of the C.N.S. in children suffering from C.P. was underscored, as--apart from dysfunctions within the kinetic area, there can be present sight, hearing and speech dysfunctions, those of sensory perceptions and mental development. These children require multispecialist care, as everyone of dysfunctions mentioned may present a complicated diagnostic problem. Plenty of place was devoted to the discussion of problems connected with epilepsy in children with C.P. Also extensively debated were the general principles of the medical procedure in children with C.P. As a result of the discussion it was decided that children with severer forms of C.P. and those from poor social conditions should be subjected to long-lasting sanatorium rehabilitation. Keeping the child in its family environment should, however, be the generally adopted principle of the rehabilitation of a little child. The parents of the child should be trained in the proper rearing of the child under household conditions, a manner to secure all the needs resulting from the then stage of its development. In connection with this problem the project of the programme of sensoric-and-kinetic rehabilitation was debated, as presented by psychologists and rehabilitants (kinesitherapeuts)."

    "abstract": "Thermodynamic studies of polymerization of deoxygenated sickle cell hemoglobin. Solubilities of deoxygenated sickle cell hemoglobin (deoxy-Hb S), at varying pH and temperature over a range of concentrations encompassing those found in erythrocytes, were measured. The technique involved ultracentrifugation, which gave values of the supernatant concentration and the mass of the sedimented material. The data establish that the solubility of doexy-Hb S is the saturation concentration and is independent of initial concentration. The mass of the pellet phase increases linearly with initial concentration. Moreover, the saturation concentration represents the critical concentration above which monomers are in equilibrium with polymers. These polymers are the putative cause of erythrocytes deformation associated with sickle cell anemia. The solubility-pH profiles of deoxy-Hb S at various temperatures, unlike those of other proteins, show no minima at the isoelectric pH but instead show a marked decrease in solubility below pH 7.0, indicating the predominance of polymerization over the expected increase in solubility. Deoxy-Hb S, within specified ranges of temperature and pH, possesses a negative temperature coefficient of solubility, a property characteristic of hydrophobic interactions. The saturation concentration is, however, temperature independent at conditions close to physiological. The enthalpy of polymerization (3.5 kcal/mol) is temperature independent from 6 degrees to 22 degrees for all pH values between 6.45 and 7.40. In the range of 22 degrees to 38 degrees, this parameter becomes less endothermic, having a value of 2.5 kcal/mol at pH 6.45 and a value of zero at pH 7.20. Such behavior of the system suggests a phase transition near 22 degreas. Within the range of conditions examined the polymerization is entropically driven."

The enzyme has a pH-optimum of about 9.6 and is inhibited by EDTA. Phosphodiesterase I (hydrolysis of thymidine-5'-monophospho-p-nitrophenylester) was also found in normal human serum, with a pH-optimum of about 9.8 and a Km of 0.20-0.25 mM. Probably both activities should be attributed to one enzyme. Different isoenzymes may exist, however. The activity of nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase I in normal serum in many respects resembles an enzyme previously isolated from liver plasma membranes. Phosphodiesterase I activity was increased in normal pregnancy, in primary biliary cirrhosis, and in patients with bone lesions, but not in acute viral hepatitis or active chronic hepatitis.

It is to be assumed that the so-called asthma diatheses is based inter alia on a genetically determined defect of the adenyl cyclase system. The role of previous infections of the respiratory tract in asthmagenesis should lie--following this working theory--not in a sensitization in the sense of an allergic reaction of the immediate type, but in the formation of a defective beta-adrenergic substance or in a blockade of the beta-receptor. A genetically determined innate defect of the beta-adrenergic receptors, or a defect acquired through infections of the respiratory tract, is hence likely to be the cause of the pathologically potentiated reactivity of the bronchia. It is likely that the infective stimuli--quite apart from this preparatory role--are later capable of triggering asthmatic paroxysms when the vegetative homeostasis is impaired. We know from the experiments of many authors that a blockade of the beta-receptors produced by chemical blocker substances, or by pertussis vaccine or various bacterial substances, results in a significant increase in bronchial reactivity towards histamine, serotonin, acetylcholine and other stimuli. We have shown in our experiments that heat-inactivated adeno viruses and influenza viruses also increase the anaphylactic shock reactivity and the histamine reactivity of the organism. On the basis of this working hypothesis, the pathomechanism of the asthmatic process is as follows in individual asthma forms: 1) In the 'purely\" allergic asthma form, the antigen-antibody reaction that occurs after sensitization (i.e. formation of skin-sensitizing allergic antibodies of the class IgE) results in re-formation and release of slow-reacting-substances. spasm of the bronchial muscles, asthmatic paroxysm. The expulsion of catecholamines that follows the release of slow-reacting-substances makes a decisive contribution to the reestablishment of the impaired homeostatic balance. It is to be assumed that this form of asthma both symptomatically and causally--using specific desensitization--can be influenced more easily than other forms of asthma with a more complicated pathogenic background. 2) In the second allergically determined form of asthma, we are confronted by the genetically fixed or acquired insufficiency of the beta-receptors in addition to the immunological mechanism. As a result of the innate or acquired blockade of the beta-receptive substance, or the relative dominance of the alpha-receptors, the catecholamines (that physiologically serve to maintain homeostasis) contribute to a protraction, intensification and perpetuation of the bronchial obstruction. In this way the asthmatic circulus vitiosus is complete..."

After a 1-h preincubation to remove endogenous insulin, adipose tissue of obese mice (C57BL/L4 ob/ob) had a lower rate of glucose metabolism than tissue which was not preincubated. In contrast, preincubation did not change the metabolism of adipose tissue from lean mice (C57B1/6J +/+). The preincubation effect was abolished in obese mice which had had their serum insulin levels lowered toward normal by streptozotocin treatment. Injection of anti-insulin serum to obese mice caused adipose tissue removed 15 min after the injection to display a rate of glucose metabolsim lower than that of tissue removed before the injection. No such effect was seen in lean mice. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that hyperinsulinemia in the obese mice causes a chronic state of insulin stimulation of their adipose tissue, possibly contributing to their high rates of lipogenesis and their obesity. Several lipogenic enzymes were measured in adipose tissue of both lean and obese mice, and no single enzymatic abnormality was detected which might explain the hyperlipogenesis. Pyruvate dehydrogenase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase were both insulin-sensitive enzymes in lean and obese mice."

The effects of manual compression of the upper lateral abdomen (C) of 73 cases of obstructive airway disease were studied in respect to the change in minute ventilation (V) 10 minutes after the procedure was performed. A mean decrease of 13% in V was found in the majority of 15 cases of bronchial asthma or chronic bronchitis and 43 patients with chronic obstructive lung disease. The use of manual compression as a therapeutic measure depends largely on the abrupt reduction of lung volume in cases of obstructive airway disease in which over-inflation of the lung is present as an acute or chronic disorder. The degree and duration of clinical benefit, i.e., relief of dyspnea, depends on such factors as the volume of air trapped in the lungs, broncho-constriction through pathologic change or bronchospasm and impairment of elastic recoil of the pulmonary parenchyma. The lowered V recorded 10 minutes after C is performed suggests that decrease in dyspnea is associated with enhanced efficiency of ventilation in some subjects with obstructive airway disease, including those with bronchial asthma as well as COLD. A brief description is presented of 10 patients with COLD in whom manual compression and other features of a rehabilitation program were employed. Mean length of life of five living subjects is 12.6 years after beginning of therapy. The mean length of life of five who died was 10.2 years after beginning of treatment."

Approximately 50% of intravenous sites developed mild (grade 1) phlebitis and 25% developed moderate (grade 2) phlebitis. The frequency of grade 1 inflammation did not differ significantly among the three cephalosporins. The proportion of individuals eventually exhibiting grade 2 phelebitis was highest with cefamandole, lowest with cephalothin (P = 0.07), and intermediate with cephapirin; however, cephapirin required a substantially greater number of doses to produce grade 2 phelebitis than did the other two drugs.

Paracetamol does not increase the anti-inflammatory effect of indomethacin or phenylbutazone and acetylsalicylic acid clearly antagonizes it. The molecule of benorylate itsel is therefore responsible for the additive anti-inflammatory effect. However, if antipyretic activity (yeast-induced hyperthermia) is examined instead of anti-inflammatory activity, the simultaneous oral administration of the different drugs always produces an additive effect. It is concluded that the antagonism between indomethacin or phenylbutazone and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs other than benorylate is present at some receptors but not all. The clinical implications of the results are discussed."

When tested for in vitro cytotoxicity by the dye exclusion test, it shows a potent activity on both tumour cell lines, with ED50 of a few ng/ml. Higher concentrations produce an extensive lysis of the cells. The cytotoxic effects of Equinatoxin are inhibited by phospholipids, thus suggesting that its mechanism of action may be related to interactions with lipids or other charged components of cell membrane. The observed lack of in vivo activity against L1210 leukaemia presumably is due to poor systemic absorption of the protein and/or neutralization by serum factors."

Increased thoroughness in collecting clinical data in the protocol system led to an increase in the recognition of new pathology. Outcome criteria reflected equivalent quality of care in both groups. Efficiency time-motion studies demonstrated a 20 per cent saving in physician time with the protocol system. Coct estimates, based on the time spent with patients by various providers and on the laboratory-test-ordering patterns, demonstrated equivalent costs of the two systems, given optimal staffing patterns. Laboratory tests were a major element of the cost of patient care,and the clinical yield per unit cost of different tests varied widely."

Pyruvate decarboxylase [2-oxo acid carboxy-lyase, EC 4.1.1.1] was isolated from sweet potato roots and was partially purified from healthy and diseased tissues. There was no appreciable difference in properties between the enzymes from healthy and diseased tissues. The molecular weight of the enzyme was found to be 240,000 by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Since sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gave a molecular weight of 60,000 for the monomeric form of the enzyme, it is likely that sweet potato pyruvate decarboxylase contains 4 single polypeptide chains. The optimal pH of the decarboxylation reaction was 6.1--6.6. The Lineweaver-Burk double reciprocal plot curved upward, and the Hill coefficient was more than 1, with low concentrations of pyruvate. The enzyme was localized in the cytosol fraction. The activity of the enzyme increased in response to black-rot fungus infection, but decreased in response to cutting."

The effects of varying pH and of increasing intracellular hemoglobin (Hb) concentration on red cell sickling and oxygen affinity were studied in whole blood from persons with sickle cell anemia (SS) and sickle cell trait (SA). Small increases in SS blood pH inhibited sickling, and small reductions in both SS and SA blood pH promoted sickling far more than accounted for by the Bohr effect. Sickling behavior correlated with minimum gelling concentrations (MGC) of deoxygenated hemolysates without 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. MGC values fell sharply when pH was lowered from 7.25 to 7.15 for HbS and from 7.15 to 6.90 for SA hemolysates, suggesting effects on specific ionic interactions involved in Hb gelation. Possible clinical counterparts are acute metabolic acidosis and alkalosis (prior to change in red cell 2,3-diphosphoglycerate), where the Bohr effect and oxygen affinity-independent effects of pH alterations on sickling would be additive. Osmotic shrinkage of HbS-containing red cells produced a large fall in oxygen affinity and a marked increase in sickling independent of that fall. The oxygen affinity and sickling properties of SA cells whose MCHC was raised to 40 per cent resembled those of unaltered SS cells, supporting a relationship between molecular aggregation of Hb and low oxygen affinity. Sickling of aerated SS cells in hypertonic saline depended upon partial Hb desaturation due to lowered oxygen affinity. Thus osmotic shrinkage of HbS-containing cells acts synergistically with partial deoxygenation to promote sickling. These conditions are present in the renal medulla, but may occur elsewhere in severe hyperosmolar states."

Synthetic substance P has been discovered to stimulate significantly the formation of dopa in the limbic, striatum, hemisphere and diencephalon regions of the brain and the lower brain stem. There was no effect upon 5-hydroxytryptophan formation or on tryptophan or tyrosine levels. After inhibition of monoamine synthesis by N'-(DL-SERYL)-N2-(2, 3, 4-trihydroxybenzyl)hydrazine, substance P significantly accelerated the disappearance of dopamine, noradrenaline and 5-hydroxytryptamine. Substance P appears to stimulate monoaminergic neurons in the brain and to serve as an excitatory transmitter in nerve terminals impinging upon dopaminergic cell bodies. A similar stimulation of noradrenaline and 5-hydroxytryptamine indicate a similar transmitter role for noradrenergic and serotonergic neurons. These data strengthen questions about the possible clinical influence of substance P in disease states involving monoaminergic mechanisms including Parkinsonism and schizophrenia."

In approximately 10,000 admissions in a 12 months period, at University Teaching Hospital, Lusaka 85 cases of meningitis were recorded. The signs and symptoms in these patients do not greatly differ from other similar studies in Africa. The commonest organism isolated was pneumococcus. There was high mortality rate which was to a large extent due to parents not bringing their children to hospital early enough for medical treatment to be instituted. This is borne out by the fact that 50% of the children with meningitis died within the first 24 hours. The C.S.F. protein and peripheral white blood count may be of prognostic value.

In 27 cases, mostly involving children less than 6 years of age, psychotropic drugs were implicated. These included sedative-hypnotics in six cases, phenytoin in two, major tranquilizers in five, antidepressants in three, stimulants or hallucinogens in three, and drug mixtures in eight. Toxicologic analyses contributed little to diagnosis and initial management. Except for one child who ingested ferrous sulfate, no patient was seriously intoxicated, and all recovered rapidly without sequelae. Although referral of serious poisoning cases to another hospital may have biased the results, the findings suggest that accidental psychotropic drug poisoning is not a major source of childhood morbidity."

    "abstract": "Torsion of the testis and allied conditions. In 15 years at Bristol there have been 293 cases of torsion of the testis, 55 cases of torsion of a testicular appendage and 5 cases of testicular ischaemia due to other causes. The risk of a male developing torsion of the testis or its appendix by the age of 25 is about 1 in 160. Both conditions occurred primarily in adolescents, but among prepubertal boys torsion of an appendage was as common as torsion of a normally descended testis. There was a slight left-sided preponderance in testicular torsion, more marked in torsion of the appendages; the incidence of bilateral torsion was 2-0 and 1-8 per cent respectively. The clinical features and differential diagnosis of the two conditions are compared. Torsion of a testicular appendage is the most commonly misdiagnosed scrotal lesion, the preoperative diagnosis being correct in only 11 per cent of cases compared with 90 per cent for torsion of the testis. Twenty-one cases of recurrent torsion underwent prophylactic bilateral orchidopexy. There were 20 cases of torsion of undescended testes, with a salvage rate of only 20 per cent. The overall testicular survival rate was 55-3 per cent. Viability depends upon the possibility of spontaneous reduction, the preoperative delay after the onset of symptoms, the degree of torsion of the cord and the length of follow-up in doubtful cases. Urgent scrotal exploration is advised in every case of acute testicular pain unless there is overwhelming evidence of epididymoorchitis. Exploration of the opposite side is mandatory in torsion of the testis and advisable in torsion of an appendage."

The effects of single oral doses of the cardioselective beta adrenoceptor blocking drugs, metoprolol and tolamolol, on specific airways resistance (SRaw) were compared with those of propranolol and practolol in 6 healthy volunteers and in 12 patients with bronchial asthma. Whole-body plethysmography was used to measure SRaw and the blocking potency of different antagonists assessed by the degree of inhibition of tachycardia due to exercise on a treadmill. The changes correlated with plasma drug levels. Propranolol and practolol were measured fluorometrically and metoprolol by electron-capture gas-liquid chromatography. In normal subjects, about 30% reduction in exercise-induced tachycardia resulted from single doses of 80 mg propranolol (plasma levels, 50.3, SD, 29.5 to 60.8, SD, 26 ng/ml), 250 mg practolol (plasma levels, 1.05, SD, 0.32 to 1.10, SD, 0.55 mug/ml), 100 mg metoprolol (plasma levels, 137, SD, 111 to 152, SD, 100 ng/ml), and 100 mg tolamolol. In patients, these doses of the drugs produced significant increases in SRaw. These increases were greater than those after placebo but significantly so only during the peak effect 1 hr after propranolol. Compared with changes after placebo, significant effects on SRaw were also found in 3 patients given 200 mg of tolamolol. None of the drugs had a significant effect on SRaw in normal subjects. It is concluded that metoprolol, practolol, and tolamolol may impair ventilatory function in asthmatics less than propranolol and that at high doses this difference may not be demonstrable."

Heat-in-activation studies showed that the platelet monoamine oxidase from iron-deficient subjects was more labile to this treatment, when compared with the platelet enzyme from normal subjects. 4. The sensitivity of platelet monoamine oxidase to the inhibitors, clorgyline and deprenil, was increased in iron-deficiency anaemia. 5. Binding studies with the 14C-binding irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor, deprenil, showed that the amount of enzyme capable of binding this inhibitor was lowered by 48% in platelets from iron-deficient patients when compared with platelets from normal subjects. 6. The results show that there is a lowered amount of active enzyme in platelets from iron-deficient subjects. It is suggested that iron is necessary either for the synthesis of monoamine oxidase apoenzyme or is a cofactor for an enzyme which attaches flavin-adenine dinucleotide covalently to the monoamine oxidase apoenzyme."

Certain conclusions may be drawn from the present review and presentation of new data concerning the unilaterally cryptorchid patient and possible subfertility: 1. The truly undescended testis--not the retractile testis of infancy--will not descend spontaneously after 1 year of age. 2. The seminal quality of the unilaterally cryptorchid patient is definitely impaired, although not rendered infertile, in a great majority of patients irrespective of the time of surgery. 3. The dystopic position of the maldescended testis appears to superimpose a second insult on what very likely may be an inherent abnormality in the cryptorchid testis, the latter accounting, perhaps, for its abnormal extrascrotal position. 4. Orchiopexy before the age of 5 seems advisable to ensure minimal histologic changes that may be secondary to the testis' increased exposure to elevated extrascrotal temperature. 5. The cryptorchid testis will be smaller in size irrespective of surgery, and usually correlates with significant testicular pathology. 6. Basal levels of gonadotropins, especially follicle-stimulating hormone, are likely to be elevated, but this does not necessarily imply overwhelming testicular damage. Androgen production should not be affected. 7. Surgical correction is advised when human chorionic gonadotropin stimulation fails to produce teticular descent, thereby defining the maldescended testis as not merely retractile but truly \"crytorchid.\""

    "abstract": "Aspirin-induced gastritis and gastrointestinal bleeding. Aspirin-induced gastritis and gastrointestinal hemorrhage were reviewed and discussed on the basis of currently available literature. Acute hemorrhagic gastritis occurs in from 50% to 70% of all patients taking aspirin, is not directly related to dose size, and can be severe enough to cause death in a few cases. No tolerance appears to ever develop. The mechanism that causes this bleeding is not definite, but the back diffusion of H+ ions accross the gastric barrier seems to bear primary responsibility, with physical erosion, prolonged platelet bleeding, and the effect of low pH values also being possible explanations. There appears to be less acid present in the stomach when bleeding occurs, but this is a masking effect of the aspirin that causes increased absorption of the H+ ions. Factors important in determining pharmaceutical formulation are method of administration, particle size of the aspirin, duration of contact between the drug and the mucosa, presence of buffers in the drug to raise the gastric pH, dissolution rate of the drug in the stomach, and ionization characteristics of the drug itself. Gastrointestinal blood loss caused by aspirin can be minimized by administering the drug in one of these forms:--a dilute solution of acetylsalicylate;--an intravenously injected solution;--a very rapidly dissolving and rapidly absorbed tablet;--a solution with sufficiently large amounts of antacid added;--a fine-grain, highly buffered aspirin tablet;--an enteric-coated tablet that does not dissolve in the stomach; or--an aspirin substitute such as acetaminophen."

The statistical analysis confirms that there is a significant rise in the number of heart rate abnormalities such as persistent bradycardia or persistent tachycardia and with dips during deliveries with fetal acidosis. The frequency of these abnormalities increases with the degree of acidosis. Sometimes the abnormalities in the fetal heart rate precede the appearance of the acidosis. All the same the discovery of these abnormalities does not by itself make a precise diagnosis of fetal distress because we do find these abnormalities in a certain number of cases even in normal deliveries.

After one of these agents plus 5-HT i.p., but not 5-HT s.c., extensive necrosis was significantly more frequent and severe in the quadriceps muscle than after 5-HT s.c. Chlorpheniramine (CP) plus 5-HT, 2.5 mg/kg intravenously, produced less muscle necrosis than CP plus 5-HT s.c. or i.p. The necrosis produced by CP plus 5-HT s.c. was comparable ipsilateral and contralateral to the injection site. The necrosis following CP plus 5-HT i.p. was maximal at 24 hr and remained fairly constant until 5 days. Regeneration was prominent by 7 days. The muscle necrosis  produced by CP plus 5-HT is blocked by some 5-HT blockers, e.g., methiotepin and methysergide. It is also partially blocked by denervation. The capacity of tricyclic antidepressants and antihistamines to block neuronal 5-HT reuptake tended to be negatively correlated with the capacity to potentiate the muscle necrosis they produced with 5-HT, which suggests that blockade of 5-HT uptake is not the mechanism of the pathology produced by the combined treatment. The tricyclic antidepressants and the antihistamines are \"membrane stabilizers-labilizers\". Other drugs which are \"membrane stabilizers-labilizers\" such as trihexyphenidyl and procaine also promoted skeletal muscle necrosis when given prior to 5-HT. It is proposed that the effects of imipramine plus 5-HT on skeletal muscle are not due to the blockade of neuronal uptake of 5-HT and subsequent vascular-induced ischemia, but reflect direct toxic effects of these agents on skeletal muscle."

Twenty-one of 56 IDM had serum Mg less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dl, on at least one occasion during the first 3 days. Serum Mg in these hypomagnesemic infants did not demonstrate the normal increase with postnatal age that was present in normomagnesemic infants. Decreased neonatal serum Mg was related to increased severity of maternal diabetes, young mothers, mothers for lower gravidity, and prematurity. Decreased serum Mg, alone or with decreased ionized or total Ca, did not correlate with neuromuscular irritability in the infants. Decreased serum Mg in IDM was associated with decreased maternal serum Mg, decreased neonatal ionized and total Ca, increased serum P, and decreased parathyroid function. Serum Mg was not related to dietary P intake, or urinary Ca or P excretion. Thus, transitory neonatal hypomagnesemia occurs in IDM; it is speculated that factors causing HM might include maternal HM or neonatal hyperphosphatemia, and that the HM is related to the hypocalcemia and functional hypoparathyroidism of IDM."

The drug is a synthetic dissaccharide which, in oral doses of 10-20 g, relieves chronic constipation (Wesselius-de Casparis, Braadbaart &amp; others, 1968). It is neither hydrolysed by intestinal dissaccharidase (Dahlqvist &amp; Gryboski, 1965) nor absorbed in the gut, but it is converted in the colon mainly to lactic and acetic acids by various bacteria including Lactobacillus acidophilus. Apart from the increased osmotic effect, the pH in the proximal colon falls markedly (Bown, Gibson &amp; others, 1974), and larger doses may reduce stool pH. Weijers &amp; others (1961) inferred that the acidic products formed from lactose in the colon stimulate propulsion, and K.S.

In 10 patients, however, no ejaculate could be collected because of their hypogonadism. 78 of these 121 patients examined by sperm count had a sufficient testicular descensus after HCG treatment. In 43 adolescents HCG therapy failed, therefore subsequent orchidopexy was performed. A normal sperm count was seen in only 39 per cent of the 121 patients. After unilateral testicular maldescensus 18%, after bilateral maldescensus 43% of the patients had to be evaluated as prospectively infertile. Maier and Spann reported sperm counts below 10(6)/ml in 9 out of 17 patients with bilateral maldescensus who had been treated by surgery alone. In the present study, however, only 9 out of 35 individuals treated for bilateral maldescensus by HCG alone showed sperm counts below 10(6)/ml. Plasma LH and FSH concentrations were determined in 93 patients, 6 out of which showed hypergonadotrophic values of FSH and sperm counts below 10(7)/ml. Subsequently, 3 cases of Klinefelter's syndrome could be diagnosed among the total group of 121 patients. The etiology of testicular maldescensus is by no means uniform since anatomical, endocrine and/or chromosomal factors are involved."

Both probably depend on immunitary dysreactivity, their different clinical expression being attributable to differences in the district involved and the age of the subject. Both are preceded or accompanied by rheumatism. An interesting relation can be made out between temporal arteritis and \"rheumatic polymyalgia\" or, more aptly, \"rhizomelic polymyalgia\" (Ballabio, 1975). The latter (of rheumatic origin) may accompany arteritis - Hamrin, indeed, has suggested their unification in the description \"arteritic polymyalgia\". It is uncertain whether vasculopathy in the course of collagen disease, rheumatic arteritis, and polyarteritis nodosa can be identified with T.O., even though a common immunological basis can be made out.

By Takayasu-Onishi's arteritis is meant an arteritic process with unknown aetiology which electively affects young women, seemingly of prevalently Asiatic stock. The disease concerns almost exclusively large elastic arteries and presents clinically with early preocclusive symptomatology followed, after a varying period, by a picture of obstructive angiopathy. Here, the most recent aetiopathogenetic findings are considered. The disease's predilection for the young female, together with certain clinical and experimental observations, suggest that a dysendocrine condition may have some pathogenetic responsibility, at least in a favourable sense; this responsibility is documented by the finding of high levels of oestrogenuria during the entire cycle in patients suffering from the disease. On the other hand, the angiopathy localization in the large elastic arteries and in certain segments of the aortic arch and epiaortic trunks means that the role of topographic moments whould not be underestimated. As regards infectious factors, the tubercular and streptococcic continue to be of great importance even today. Neither acts directly, however, but by way of an abnormal immunitary reaction which they seem able to trigger off. The infectious moment would thus appear to be related to the immunitary moment, and the latter would seem to play the part of perpetuating the pathological vascular involvement promoted by contact of the organism with the aetiological agent."

Sarcoidosis is a disease of unknown etiology that is characterized by the generalized formation of granulomas and is accompanied by elevation in the serum in less than half the patients of angiotensin converting enzyme, a dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of the decapeptide, angiotensin I, to the pressor octapeptide, angiotensin II, and L-histidyl-L-leucine. Mean activity of angiotensin converting enzyme was elevated generally more than 10-fold in granuloma-containing lymph nodes, but not in lung in which normally it is abundant, in 19 of 20 patients with sarcoidosis. Angiotensin converting enzyme in lymph nodes from subjects with sarcoidosis was similar to the enzyme from normal lung and lymph node with respect to activity as a function of pH, inhibition of activity by EDTA and o-phenanthroline, gel filtration on Sephadex G-200, and requirement for chloride for activity, but appeared to be more heat labile. The data suggest that the granulomas in sarcoidosis may be the source of the elevated serum enzyme and that cells of the granulomas, particularly the epitheloid cells which appear by electron microscopy to have active protein biosynthesis, may be actively synthesizing the enzyme."

Metachromatic leukodystrophy and Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome can be diagnosed by assay of leukocyte or fibroblast arylsulfatase A and B activity with the fluorogenic substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate. The arylsulfatases are extracted into a 27000 x g supernatant by sonication in 0.9% sodium chloride and then separated with CM-32 on columns or in test tubes. In 0.05 M sodium acetate pH 6.0, arylsulfatase A is not absorbed while arylsulfatase B is retained by the resin. The arylsulfatase B is then eluted from the resin with 0.3 M sodium chloride. The arylsulfatase A activity obtained from normal leukocytes and fibroblasts is linear for the initial 10 minutes of the reaction, is stimulated 3-fold by 6 mM lead acetate and inhibited 80% by 0.24 mM silver nitrate. After separation with CM-32, the arylsulfatase B activity is stimulated 3-fold by Triton X-100 (0.1%). Arylsulfatase A but not arylsulfatase B is destroyed by heat (60 degrees). Both leukocyte and fibroblast arylsulfatase A activity was reduced to 11% of control values in metachromatic leukodystrophy. Essentially no arylsulfatase B activity was detected in cells from patients with Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome. Metachromatic leukodystrophy heterozygotes but not Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome heterozygotes can also be distinguished by this method. A heat inactivation technique utilizing the differential thermal stabilities of the two enzymes for diagnosis of patients with Marotezux-Lamy syndrome is also described. The advantages of these 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate assay procedures over the p-nitrocatechol sulfate method of assay are greater sensitivity, selectivity for the desired enzyme and potential for use in large scale testing."

Two readily obtainable biological fluids, i.e., urine and tears, were investigated as possible substitutes for serum and leukocytes for the detection of Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) heterozygotes based on Quantitative hexosaminidase A (Hex A) determinations. 2. Hexosaminidase isoenzyme patterns were determined, by means of an automated DEAE-cellulose microcolumn procedure, for serum, urine and tear samples from normals, TSD carriers, normal pregnancies, carrier-pregnancies and TSD children. 3. Normal pregnancy and TSD carrier sera gave almost identical hexosaminidase patterns with multiple intermediate peaks. Whereas, urine and tear samples from normal pregnant women showed hexosaminidase isoenzyme patterns resembling those of normal controls. These results suggested that use of these fluids might eliminate the effect of pregnancy of the Hex A ratio which occurs when serum is used as the test fluid. In addition these fluids are most economical and simpler to obtain than a blood sample. 4. About 200 urine samples, from the various categories listed above, were analyzed for Hex A with both the heat denaturation and pH inactivation methods and the results compared with serum and leukocyte levels from many of the same individuals. With either method, the wide overlap between the urinary Hex A normal and heterozygote ranges would require retesting with leukocytes of about 30% of the subjects. These results would preclude the use of urines as a suitable fluid for the mass screening of the Ashkenazic Jewish population for TSD heterozygotes."

    "abstract": "[Hepatic amebiasis in the Kilimanjaro region. Serodiagnosis on micro-specimens of dried blood and attempts at treatment with tinidazole (fasigyn)]. Amoebic dysentery appears to be rare in the northeast of Tanzania. Hepatic amoebiasis, on the other hand, is apparently widespread since at least 200 cases are seen every year at the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre. This incidence of cases enabled us to carry out trials on the spot with a new imidazole derivative, Tinidazole. Formerly the difficult diagnosis based on clinical symptoms had to be buttressed by radiological evidence and possibly by the result of puncture. Indirect fluorescent antibody tests for the diagnosis of amoebiasis were performed elsewhere on all the patients, using for this purpose microspecimens of dried blood. In 12 cases out of 34 an agglutination test with sensitized latex particles was performed on the spot. This latter test has the practical advantage of being easy to employ. It cannot, however, be considered as a screening test since it is subject to downward and upward errors. The indirect fluorescent antibody test has been found to be constantly and highly positive, certain antibody titres attaining 1/6400. This fully confirms the value of the method even under special working conditions. Seventeen of our 34 patients (2 women and 15 men ranging in age from 20 to 75 years) were treated with 2 g of Tinidazole per day in a single dose for 2 to 3 consecutive days. Puncture to evacuate pus was also performed where abscesses had collected. Tolerance on the whole was good without a single sign of cardiovascular or urinary toxicity. However, paraesthesia of the hands was observed in one case, transitory thrombocytopenia in one other patient, and increased alkaline phosphatases. Minor disorders were also observed in our series of patients: mild vertigo (7 cases), headache (6 cases), and dry mouth (2 cases). After 8 months the therapeutic results were as follows: 12 complete cures out of 17, 2 improvements with final cure probable, 3 partial failures necessitating supplementary treatment with Metronidazole (2.4 g per day for 2 days). These preliminary trials appear to the encouraging and the study is being continued with series compared with cases treated with Emetine or Metronidazole."

We had the opportunity of studying an epidemic of autochthonous amoebiasis occurring in the autumn of 1974 in a small town of 4000 inhabitants 30 km from Grenoble. Attention was originally attracted by the occurrence in this town of two cases of hepatic amoebiasis and one of intestinal amoebiasis identified by rectoscopy. Systematic investigations (coproctic examinations and serological tests for amoebiasis by indirect antibody fluorescence) were then carried out on everyone in the locality with digestive disorders which were possibly referable to amoebiasis, and on the other members of their families. A total number of 148 coproctic examinations were made and in two cases revealed the presence of vegetative forms of Entamoeba histolytica. In both cases the infestation provoked few symptoms (asthenia, vague abdominal discomfort, intermittent and apparently banal diarrhoea). On the other hand 20 out of 94 serological tests revealed positive results, 14 of which were equal to or greater than a titre of 1/100, a level at which all risks of non-specificity are virtually ruled out under our experimental conditions. Material reasons made it impossible to subject these cases to repeated faecal checks, but in two of them at least the rectoscopic appearances were very suggestive of subacute intestinal amoebiasis. Moreover, amoebic disease appears to be well confirmed by the results obtained among the patients as a whole by treatment with Metroinidazole. A variety of hypotheses on the origin of this epidemic have been put forward and then abandoned (market garden produce, receipt by certain families of exotic frut from overseas). In actual fact water seems to be the point of departure, for, although specimens of water taken at 7 different levels in the water supply system failed to reveal the presence of a single amoeba, bacteriological analyses during autumn 1974 showed signs of faecal contamination. The locality, which is situated at the foot of the Chartreuse massif, receives its water solely from springs but there is a holiday camp for the staff of an international airline situated above the main water catchment."

In a double-blind controlled investigation, each volunteer was studied during four consecutive nights. In randomized order they received either 100, 200, or 300 mg of cimetidine or a placebo. No untoward clinical orlaboratory effects of the drug were found. Single-dose oral administration of 300 mg cimetidine caused a significant (P less than 0.05) inhibition of overnight gastric acid secretion for an 8-hr period, with the intragastric pH staying between 3.5-6.0. Cimetidine, because of its potent gastric acid inhibitory effect, may become an important therapeutic agent in the management of peptic ulcer disease."

Significant alterations in heart carbohydrate and lipid metabolism are present 48 h after intravenous injection of alloxan (60 mg/kg) in rats. It has been suggested that uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation occurs in the alloxanized rat heart in vivo, whereas normal oxidative metabolism has been demonstrated in alloxan-diabetic rat hearts perfused in vitro under conditions of adequate oxygen delivery. We examined the hypothesis that high-energy phosphate metabolism might be adversely affected in the alloxan-diabetic rat heart in vivo. Phosphocreatine and ATP were reduced by 58 and 45%, respectively (P is less than 0.001). Also, oxygen-dissociation curves were shifted to the left by 4 mmHg, and the rate of oxygen release from blood was reduced by 21% (P is less than 0.01). Insulin administration normalized heart high-energy phosphate compounds. ATP production was accelerated in diabetic hearts perfused in vitro with a well-oxygenated buffer. These studies support the hypothesis that oxidative ATP production in the alloxan-diabetic rat heart is reduced and suggest that decreased oxygen delivery may have a regulatory role in the oxidative metabolism of the diabetic rat heart."

Out of 543 tracheotomized patients, 227 survived and 12 of them developed a tracheal stenosis syndrome (5,28 p. 100) including: 3 supra-ostial stenosis, 1 ostial and supra-ostial stenosis, 1 ostial stenosis, 3 intermediate stenosis and 4 distal stenosis. In two cases, the stenosis was found out during the removal of the cannula and in the other cases from 3 days to 8 months after the decannulation. The deffered treatment consisted in an anti-inflammatory medical treatment treatment (one case), in a permanent dilation with an Albouker tube (two cases), and in a resection of the stenosed tracheal part plus an anastomosis. Good results were obtained in 9 cases including the recovery of a satisfactory tracheal diameter. Because of a recurrence of the stenosis after resection and anastomosis, it was necessary, in two cases, to resort to another resection and, upon another occasion, to place a permanent cannulation. Finally, in one case, 2 Rethi operations were necessary to get a sub-normal tracheal diameter. From these facts, it emerges that tracheal stenosis are less important if, during the tracheotomy, a partial resection of the tracheal wall is effected (rather than an inverted U flap folded back at the bottom) together with the putting in of a cannula equipped with an elongated cylindrical cuff requiring a less important filing-up pressure (although just as efficient as far as tightness is concerned)."

Two adrenergic aerosols were compared in a double blind, matched-pair study of 6 months' duration in 28 adult patients with chronic bronchial asthma, and in a double blind, crossover, short-term study in 18 children with severe asthma. In the adult study, one member of each pair was given either 150 mug of isoproterenol or 200 mug of carbuterol 4 times per day, by inhalation, for 6 months. In the childhood study, 18 children, 6 to 12 years of age, with moderate to severe asthma were studied in a double blind, crossover therapeutic trial in which high or low doses of aerosolized carbuterol or isoproterenol were given 4 times daily for 5 days each. Treatment results were evaluated by measuring forced vital capacity, 1-sec forced expiratory volume, and maximal mid-expiratory flow (FEF25-75%) at regulat intervals before and after administration of the respective test drugs. In the adult study, there was a significant difference between carbuterol and isoproterenol for forced vital capacity (P less than 0.02), for 1-sec forced expiratory volume (P less than 0.02), and for FEF25-75% (P less than 0.01) in favor of carbuterol. In the pediatric study, the difference between carbuterol and isoproterenol was significant (P less than 0.05) only for the FEF25-75% on the fifth day of treatment with the high dose administration of carbuterol. There was no associated toxicity of either drug with respect to electrocardiogram, blood chemistry, or subjective complaints. Tachyphylaxis (tolerance with time) to isoproterenol appeared to develop in one patient."

The 17 beta-HOR activity from the MP was localized predominantly in the microsomal fraction, as it is in normal testicular tissue. With DHA, A, and estrone as substrates, the 17 beta-HOR activity of the MP was decreased in the presence of NADPH, but not NADH, in comparison with the normal. NADPH was the preferred co-factor for 17 beta-HOR from the normal testes, while 17 beta-HOR activity from the MP testes was less with NADPH than with NADH as cofactor.

This study was designed to test the effectiveness of disodium cromoglycate when compared to placebo in a double-blind study in patients with ragweed allergic rhinitis. Patients were selected on the basis of a clinical history and a 4+ reaction to the intradermal injection of water-soluble ragweed, 0.02 c.c. of 500 PNU/c.c. Active agent/placebo groups were selected at random and were on the drug for approximately 8 wk, commencing 1 wk prior to the onset of the ragweed pollen season. Patient response was evaluated using patient diary cards, number of antihistamine tablets taken, and patient interviews. In the Toronto study, of 17 patients on the active drug, 15 were graded as improved, compared to only 6 of 21 placebo-treated patients who were improved. However, in the Hamilton study, results were less impressive. Nonetheless, it appears that intranasal insufflation of disodium cromoglycate was more effective in reducing ragweed hay fever symptoms than placebo."

The small intestine is a well documented target organ in mouse and human GVHD, and diarrhea is a prominent part of the clinical GVHD syndrome. Although a plethora of systemic immune deficits has been documented in GVHD, the integrity of the small intestinal immune system has not been investigated. A correlation has not been demonstrated between systemic immune dysfuction and the incidence of lymphomas in mouse GVHD survivors. If gastrointestinal immune deficiency exists in mouse GVHD, its possible relationship to GVHD lymphomas, frequently abdominal. should be investigated. GVHD was produced in newborn BLA (C57 BL/Ka females x BALB-C males) mice house in a specific pathogen-free environment by the i.p. inoculation of 10(7) male BALB-C spleen cells. Control mice received syngeneic spleen cells. Twenty GVHD and 16 control mice were sacrificed at 3 weeks and specimens of duodenum were removed for routine histologic and immunofluorescent examination. All but one GVHD mouse (95%) had virtually absent duodenal IgA and IgM. Duodenal cellular fluorescence was demonstrated in all controls. A significant duodenal immunoglobulin deficit has been demonstrated in 3-week-old GVHD mice. The relationship of this finding to GVHD diarrhea, wasting, and neoplasia remains to be determined."

We determined the incidence of pneumothorax in 295 infants (mean birthweight, 1,917 gm) with the respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) treated according to the same protocol. Fifty-five infants (mean birthweight, 1,594 gm) developed pneumothorax (incidence, 19%); incidence varied with severity of RDS and intensity of respiratory assistance. Pneumothorax occurred in 3.5% (2 of 58) of infants who received no assisted ventilation and in 11% (14 of 124) of infants who received continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) as the only form of assisted ventilation; the difference between these two groups is not significant. Forty-nine infants initially treated with CPAP later required mechanical ventilation with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Pneumothorax occurred in 12 of the 49 (24%) and in 21 of 64 (33%) of those infants initially treated with PEEP; the incidence of pneumothorax for both these groups was significantly higher than for those treated with no assisted ventilation or CPAP only. To assess the value of frequent measurement of vital signs, blood gas tensions, and pH in the recognition of pneumothorax, we analyzed these variables by the cumulative sum statistical technique. We noted the following significant changes associated with pneumothorax: arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate decreased in 77% of cases; pulse pressure narrowed in 51% of cases; Po2 decreased in 17 of 20 cases in which ventilatory settings were constant for at least three hours prior to pneumothorax. However, pH and Pco2 showed consistent changes. Frequent measurements of vital signs and Po2 aid in the early diagnosis of pneumothorax."

Specific polysomes involved the the synthesis of acetyl-CoA carboxylase [acetyl-CoA: carbon-dioxide ligase (ADP-forming), EC 6.4.1.2] have been identified by the binding of 125I-labeled antiacetyl-CoA carboxylase to rat liver polysomes. The binding is highly specific and occurs through the recognition of the nascent peptide chains on polysomes. With the use of the 125I-labeled antibody binding technique, it has been demonstrated that the relative content of acetyl-CoA carboxylase-synthesizing polysomes in the liver correlates well with the rate of hepatic synthesis of the enzyme in rats subjected to different dietary conditions as well as in alloxan-diabetic rats with or without insulin treatment."

Proliferative cells as determined by the spleen colony assay and the in vitro agar colony-forming assay are present in this fraction as are cells responsive to mitogenic stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). B6CBF1 mice grafted with CBA adherent cells exhibit a gradual return over a period of 5 months to normal PHA and LPS stimulation levels as shown by splenic cell responses of these mice to mitogens.

The efficacy of tolamolol, a cardioselective beta adrenergic blocking agent, was evaluated in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias in 27 patients. Nineteen patients had supraventricular arrhythmias and eight had ventricular arrhythmias. Evaluation was by doulbe-blind randomized trial in 23 patients. Tolamolol was effective in reducing ventricular rate in 17 (85 percent) of 19 patients with supraventricular arrhythmias and resulted in conversion to sinus rhythm in 2 of the 17. The mean ventricular rate in 17 patients decreased from 135 to 102/min 10 minutes after initiation of administration of tolamolol and gradually decreased further to 93/min after 60 minutes. Reduction in ventricular rate was sustained for 2 hours of monitoring undergone by all patients and for 4 and 6 hours monitoring in two subgroups. Among the eight patients with ventricular ectopic beats, tolamolol reduced their frequency in four patients and had no effect in four. Six patients had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and experienced no adverse clinical effects on respiratory function in association with administration to tolamolol. Untoward effects occurred in 10 patients, including hypotension in 3, 1 of whom required vasopressor therapy. Other side effects were sedation, nausea, dyspnea and warmth in the chest, all of which were mild and transient, requiring no treatment. Cardioselective beta adrenergic blockade with tolamolol was highly effective in controlling ventricular rate in supraventricular arrhythmias and reduced the frequency of ventricular ectopic beats in half of the small group of patients with this arrhythmia. It is particularly applicable in patients with obstructive pulmonary disease in whom cardiac beta adrenergic blockade is indicated. Hypotension is an important potential side effect."

The chemical constituents of coal have not been fully characterized in relation to the incidence of coal workers' pneumoconiosis (CWP). In this study two soft coals obtained from mines in which workers had high and low incidences of CWP were leached with aqueous base and acid to remove their acidic and basic components. The results suggest that humic substances similar to those found in soil are present in the coal samples. Further, differences in the quantity of material removed ant its metal-binding and enzyme inhibitory activity are related to disease incidence."

The second activity, with a pH optimum between pH 5.2 and 5.8 is the dominant form in serum. These two forms can be differentiated from each other by gel-filtration, chromatography on DEAE-cellulose or chromatography on Concanavalin-A Sepharose. Using the chromatographic techniques, the serum type neutral activity co-elutes with the acidic forms of the enzyme. However, these two forms can be easily distinguished by effect of pH, heating or inhibition by the substrate methyl-alpha-D-mannopyranoside.

    "abstract": "Successful bone marrow transplantation against mixed lymphocyte culture barrier. If bone marrow transplantation is to become widely applicable in the treatment of patients with leukemia and aplastic anemia, the necessity to have a perfectly histocompatible donor must be overcome. In an effort to define the roles of HL-A type and mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) reactivity in the determination of successful engraftment and the occurrence of graftversus-host disease (GVHD), we have attempted transplantation of a child with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) using an HL-A identical, MLC-reactive sibling donor. Successful engraftment has been accomplished, as documented by the appearance of multiple donor genetic markers in the recipient. There is no evidence of severe GVHD. The recipient is alive, without evidence of leukemia, and has returned to full activities 9 mo after transplantation. The recipient now produces lymphocytes, which have the MLC reactivity that characterize the donor's lymphocytes, rather than that of her own pretransplant lymphocytes. This experience demonstrates that successful bone marrow transplantation in patients with leukemia can be accomplished in the face of MLC reactivity."

There was not significant difference between propranolol and metoprolol, which both potentiated the initial hypoglycaemic action of the insulin and delayed the return to normoglycaemia. Acebutolol, even though potentiating the initial hypoglycaemia, did not possess a significant delaying effect. A similar trial should be undertaken in diabetics to determine with certainty the safety of such drugs in diabetes mellitus."

Inherited organic acidemias are a group of metabolic disorders currently being described and investigated as gas-liquid chromatography is applied to unexplained diseases of infancy and childhood. Common clinical presentations include attacks of ketoacidosis, unexplained metabolic acidosis, failure of normal development, seizures, and other neurologic abnormalities. Hyperglycinemia, hyperammonemia, and hypoglycemia are other laboratory findings frequently present. Diagnosis depends on examination of urine, and sometimes blood, by gas-liquid chromatography to measure concentrations of organic acids and organic acid derivatives. Prognosis in many cases is excellent if diagnosis is made promptly and the metabolic acidosis can be reversed. Recovery from neurologic deficits has frequently been seen. Long-term therapy is generally dependent on restricting precursors of the toxic organic acid which builds up as a consequence of the enzyme deficiency. If there is some enzyme activity retained or if alternate metabolic pathways exist, success with therapy is likely."

The results were proved statistically. After a 3 to 4 weeks treatment the concentration of cholesterol as well as tryglicerides in the serum decreased significantly. After 6 to 8 weeks treatment the lipid-lowering effect was even stronger. Nearly 90% of the patients investigated gave a positive response to the treatment. Part of the population had undergone a treatment with other lipid-lowering agents before-most likely without sufficient success-in these cases a further lipid-lowering effect due to Etofibrat could be shown. Under-dosage in premedication cannot be excluded. The stratification of the patients in different groups of diagnosis showed a nearly similarity of both blood lipids independent of the diagnosis. This could also be confirmed for the group of patients suffering from diabetes. To prove the lipid-lowering efficacy of Etofibrat a population was withdrawn from treatment. Cholesterol as well as tryglicerides increased significantly during the interval without treatment. During a long-term study both lipid fractions could be kept down without increasing of the daily Etofibrat dose. The tolerance of Etofibrat was stated to be good up to very good. Objectively the measured enzymes SGOT, SGPT and gamma-GT showed a decrease of the means. Subjectively the occurrence of an often intermediate heat sensation and/or rubedo was of relevance. The low daily dose compared with other lipid-lowering agents gives indication for a better pharmacocinetic behaviour of the drug;"

Renal acidification was evaluated in patients with sickle-cell disease (HvSS) with both oral NH4CI and NaHC03 and the results were compared to those of subjects with sickle-cell trait (HbAS) and controls. The pH of arterial blood was normal in HbSS subjects but their PC02 and [HC03] were lower than those of controls. In response to NH4CI, six of 20 HbSS subjects had an abnormal minimal urine pH (greater than 5.3) and the entire HbSS group had a higher mean value than did either controls or HbAS subjects. Since none of the six HbSS subjects had evidence of proximal tubular abnormalities, it was concluded that they exhibited the syndrome of incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis. Only one of the six HbSS volunteers with an abnormal response to NH4CI and two of seven with a normal response increased their urinary PC02 normally after bicarbonate loading. PAH clearance was significantly higher and inulin clearance tended to be higher in HbSS subjects than in either controls or HbAS subjects. Maximal concentrating ability was decreased in both sickle-cell groups but more so in HbSS. No adverse effects occurred and no appearance or increase in per cent of sickled cells resulted from short-duration NH4CI acid-loading. No differences were found either in the clinical characterstics or in hematological, renal, and acid-base variables between the HbSS subjects with and without a normal response to acid-loading. The mechanism for the observed renal acidification abnormality remains unknown."

In cystic fibrosis there is chronic infection and inflammatory reaction in the airways, accompanied by destruction and shedding of airway epithelium.

We compared the status of these processes in cystic fibrosis with that in chronic bronchitis and bronchiectasis, by examining the sputum raised from the lower airways. Measurements also were made on sputum induced in normal subjects. The results indicate that migration of leukocytes into the airways and shedding of damaged airway epithelium were minimal in the normal subjects; they were significant in the patients with chronic bronchitis, higher in those with bronchiectasis, and still higher in those with cystic fibrosis. The large increases found in the total content of DNA and solids in the cystic fibrosis sputum were due to increases in the insoluble fraction containing the whole leukocytes and particulate debris that remained when the sputum mucus gel was solubilized with mercaptoethanol. Despite the large increases in the total content of DNA and solids, the contents of mucus gel components and of deoxyribonucleoprotein from disintegrated leukocytes actually present in the mucus gel structure of the cystic fibrosis sputum were not significantly higher than in the sputum from the patients with chronic bronchitis or brochiectasis."

A possible basis for a local formation of DNA-anti-DNA complexes in systemic lupus erythematosus. In vitro, collagen and collagen-like material in GBM, were demonstrated to have a particular high affinity for any DNA tested (mammalian, bacterial, viral, and plant). GBM fixed DNA 40-80 times more than HGG and BSA and 10-40 times more than bacterial LPS. GBM has a higher affinity for SSDNA than for DSDNA. This binding was inhibited at low pH, low ionic strength, and in the presence of anionic detergents, indicating that the highly negatively charged DNA may interact with the basic site on collagen or GBM by electrostatic forces. This interaction was competitively interfered with by DNA-binding proteins such as Clq. Complexes formed of DNA and anti-DNA antibodies did not exhibit the same binding property as free DNA. However, DNA which was already bound to GBM or to collagen could very efficiently bind anti-DNA antibodies and form immune complexes which would remain on these structures. The biological significance of the binding of DNA to GBM or to collagen should be particularly considered in relation to the pathogenesis of SLE. It is possible that DNA released from disrupted or degenerating cells would bind to surrounding collagen fibers or to basement membranes and then act as an immunoabsorbant for circulating anti-DNA antibodies. Some evidence for an in vivo binding of SSDNA to renal structures was obtained in mice treated with bacterial LPS 2 days before the injection of SSDNA."

Despite its imperfections, arteriography, when it demonstrates aneurysms, is an important element in diagnosis in all those cases in which histological findings are not definitive. It should be carried out before renal biopsy, given the risk of traumatic rupture of a possible aneurysm. The discovery of isolated distal arterial stenoses is not characteristic, though in the presence of a suggestive clinical picture, amy be considered as an argument in favour of the diagnosis. They occur frequently in the arteries of the digestive tract even in the absence of any abdominal symptoms or signs. Arteriography also has a prognostic value in establishing the extent of arterial lesions and, finally, is useful in the diagnosis of certain complications such as visceral haematomas and digestive haemorrhages. We thus feel that polyarteritis nodosa should be the object of a complete vascular exploration, including aortography with selective renal studies but also coelio-mesenteric opacification. In the light of the clinical context, the distal limb arteries may also be explored. Thus the diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa is not purely histological but also arteriographic."

The incorporation of D-glucose-14C(U) in amino acids of brain and liver from rats pretreated with reserpine or with phenothiazines. Following treatment with reserpine or alternatively with a combination of phenothiazines (Randolektil, Majeptil) a drug-induced parkinsonoid reaction was provoked in rats. Twenty min before decapitation, 18 muCi d-glucose-14C(U) was administered intravenously. Concentration and radioactivities of glutamic acid (glu), glutamine (gln), serine (ser), and glycine (gly) were assayed in some regions of brain and in liver. Separation was performed by a combination of paper electrophoresis and chromatography or by an automatic amino acid analyzer. 1 After reserpine, the concentrations of serine and glycine were increased ten-fold while their specific activities decreased by the same factor. The interconversion serine-glycine was not affected. The concentration of glutamic acid was reduced while its specific activity remained constant. 2. After phenothiazines, the concentrations of serine and glycine in brain were also increased but their specific activities were decreased to a different degree. This indicates an additional effect on the serine-synthesis from glucose. The interconversion serine-glycine was also altered. The concentration of glutamic acid was decreased but specific activity was constant except in the thalamus region tested. 3. The influence of both treatments on amino acid turnover in liver differed from the observed impairment of brain metabolism. 4. Possible correlations between the changes in amino acid metabolism, catecholamines, and the neurologic parkinsonian symptoms are discussed."

Six patients, not previously treated, with classical seropositive rheumatoid arthritis and highly active synovitis of one or both knee joints were treated with 4 g of 40% benorylate suspension twice daily for a period of 9--14 days prior to synovectomy. Blood samples were taken at scheduled times during administration of the drug. At operation, synovial fluid and tissue samples were taken and their salicylate, paracetamol and benorylate content measured. Plasma levels of salicylate and paracetamol were, in general, significantly higher than the concentration of these metabolites in the synovial fluid. Benorylate was found in the synovial tissues concentrated especially in the highly inflamed synovial villi. It is probable that benorylate and its metabolites penetrate the synovia but further studies are needed to determine if the metabolites are concentrated in the different synovial cell layers in the same way as benorylate itself. It is possible that part of the clinical effect of benorylate is due to its presence in the synovial tissue and that it has a direct effect in vivo on the synovial membrane. It is also possible that the pharmacokinetic properties of benorylate permit it to enter cell layers inaccessible to its metabolites."

Benorylate is obtained by esterification of acetylsalicylic acid and N-acetyl p-aminophenol (4-acetamidophenyl 2-acetoxybenzoate). Experimentally, this new product has been shown to be a good analgesic and anti-inflammatory agent. A clinical trial was carried out in order to study the efficacy, side effects and tolerance of this new product. In a group of 49 hospitalised patients aged from 20 to 70 years who were treated with this new product, 15 had ankylosing spondylitis, 11 had chronic progressive rheumatoid arthritis, 4 had Reiter's syndrome, 4 had psoriatic arthropathy, 8 had osteoarthrosis of the hip and 7 had various forms of rheumatism. The drug was administered orally in suspension form, initially three times per day, then twice, the total daily doses being 15 ml (6 g) or 20 ml (8 g). Treatment was regarded as effective in 62% of the cases, and of these 62%, 46% good and very good results were obtained. In 88% of the patients, tolerance was satisfactory and of these, it was excellent in 80%. Only in 2 cases did treatment have to be discontinued on account of side effects. From the biological point of view, uricaemia was significantly reduced in 7 patients, and in 6 patients uricuria increased. With regard to the level of salicylate in the blood assays showed that it is the same for 6 g benorylate and for 4 g aspirin. Benorylate has been shown to be an effective treatment for both inflammatory and degenerative rheumatic disorders. The results of its use can be compared with those obtained by acetylsalicylic acid, but is better tolerated. In addition, in chronic disorders it is better to have to take the product only twice per day."

    "abstract": "A review of benorylate - a new antirheumatic drug. Benorylate (Benoral, Benortan) is the esterification product of paracetamol and acetylsalicylic acid. It has anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic properties. Benorylate is probably absorbed as the intact molecule which accounts for its good gastric tolerance. After absorption, benorylate is hydrolysed into its components, salicylate and paracetamol, which then follows the usual routes of metabolism. Benorylate per se is also found in inflamed tissue and several studies, both in vivo and in vitro, have shown that it probably has an anti-inflammatory action of its own. Pharmacokinetic studies have shown that a twice daily administration of benorylate should be sufficient for a therapeutic effect and this has been confirmed by its use in patients. Clinical studies have compared benorylate with aspirin, indomethacin, ibuprofen and phenylbutazone and have shown its value in rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthrosis and other musculoskeletal conditions. The overall tolerance is excellent. Some minor gastric disturbances are reported from time to time, but these are less than with comparable doses of aspirin. Studies measuring occult blood loss in the stools have shown that this is not a significant problem with benorylate and that the majority of patients lose no more blood than the controls."

In patients with hyperthyroidism the serum activities of the leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) and the alanine aminopeptidase (AAP) as well as the alanine aminopeptidase excretion in the urine were determined. A significantly increased activity of the leucine aminopeptidase in the serum and an increased excretion of alanine aminopeptidase in the urine were found. The AAP in the serum did not show a significant increase of activity. On account of the changes in the serum and in the urine before and during therapy a low-grade participation of the hepatobiliary and renal systems which are clinically not uppermost is to be assumed. Increased excretion of AAP and hyperthyroidism coincide nearly without exception in out patients. Correlation-statistical investigations make it probable to regard the increased excretion of AAP in the urine as an indirect parameter of the peripheral metabolism in hyperthyroidism."

At this time no reliable and harmless drugs that speed up the healing of duodenal ulcers and prevent relapses are yet available. Candidates for this are H2 receptor blockers, prostaglandines and possibly substances resembling secretin. 3. Only some of the participants considered it necessary to do endoscopic and radiological follow-ups in duodenal ulcers. 4. Proximal gastric vagotomy for the treatment of duodenal ulcers is still undergoing clinical trials. At present this method should only be used by surgeons with a special interest in gastric surgery who also dispose of the technology and the staff for careful postoperative checks on these patients. The advantages of proximal gastric vagotomy consist in sparing truncation, low mortality and good functional results. 5. In gastric ulcers--contrary to duodenal ones--malignancy should always be suspected. If medical treatment does not lead to complete remission within a few months, surgery must be performed. 6. Many surgeons still prefer resection to vagotomy and excision in the management of gastric ulcers."

    "abstract": "[Interaction between gastrointestinal hormones and endocrine regulation]. The vicinity of several hormone-producing glands as part of the anatomy of the intestinal tract and the resulting interaction has been confirmed by the discovery of hormonal factors of a specifically gastro-intestinal origin. Today we are mainly interested in the interaction between intermediary metabolism and incretory intestinal function; this is characterized by the joint action of conventional glandular hormones such as insulin and pancreatic glucagon as well as by the incretion of diffuse intestinal organs, hormones such as secretin, pancreozymin, motilin, VIP and GIP. The latter are at present subject of active research with the object of discovering their physiological significance be it as tissue hormones or as humoral agents with a \"long distance\" impact; their role within pathophysiology is also of interest. GIP (\"gastric inhibitory peptide\"), apart form acting upon the intestinal tract, also causes a marked rise in insulin production; this GIP possibly is the factor responsible for the difference in glucose tolerance following i. v. or oral administration of glucose, something that scientists have been trying to discover for a long time. We have also endeavored to investigate somatostatin. This substance was originally discovered as a hypothalamic factor with inhibitory action on growth hormone secretion; in the meantime, however, cells containing and possibly also producing somatostatin have also been detected in the intestine and particularly in the islets of Langerhans (D-cells). Since somatostatin inhibits insulin secretion and especially glucagon release as well as the exretory functions of the stomach and of the pancreas, the significance of this hormone possibly is that of a tissue hormone with inhibitory action on adjacent cells. As factor inhibiting both endocrine and exocrine secretory processes it would combine these two complexes. The possible therapeutic significance of somatostatin administration to diabetics would lie in the saving of insulin. A third sector of present-day research deals with the interaction between the calcium metabolism and the hormones involved as well as the intestine. We know that patients suffering from primary hyperparathyroidism are prone to contract stomach ulcers and pancreatitis; patients with a gastrinoma and a hyperfunction of the epithelial bodies suffer from a Zollinger-Ellison-sindrome and this again suggests association with endocrine polyadenomatosis (Wermer syndrome). The inhibitory action of the parathormone antagonist calcitonin on the exocrine functions of the intestinal tract, such as the acid secretion of the stomach and the enzyme secretion of the pancreas, have already given rise to some considerations and experiments relative to treatment.

It strongly depressed appearance of both direct and indirect plaque-forming cells and produced a clear dose-dependent inhibition of haemagglutinin formation in mice upon oral administration. Skin graft rejection in mice and graft-versus-host disease in mice and rats were considerably delayed by cycloporin A which also prevented the occurrence of paralysis in rats with experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. This compound was not only highly effective in preventing development of Freund's adjuvant arthritis, but in addition improved the symptoms in rats with established arthritis, although it is inactive in acute inflammation. This new agent contrasts with other immunosuppressives and cytostatic drugs in its weak myelotoxicity. Experimental evidence suggests that cyclosporin A, rather than being cytostatic or lympholytic, affects an early stage of mitogenic triggering of the immunocompetent lymphoid cell."

Psoriatic scale proteases were found to be extracted effectively in salt solution (1 mol/l) containing Triton X-100 (5 g/l). The extraction in dilute buffer or sucrose yielded low activities. The acid (0.25 N H2SO4) and KSCN (2 mol/l) solutions effectively extracted plasminogen activator. Fibrinolysin was most active in salt (1 mol/l KCl) and in KSCN (2 mol/l) extracts. Psoriatic scale proteases were fractionated by Sephadex G-100 gel filtration and further by DEAE cellulose chromatography. Five different enzyme preparations were obtained. The first preparation, resembling cathepsin D, effectively hydrolysed hemoglobin at pH 3.5 and casein at pH 5.8 and was insensitive to protease modifiers. The second preparation effectively hydrolysed trypsin substrates (AGLME, TAME, BAEE and BANA) and also histone and casein at pH 7.2 and was inhibited by protease inhibitors, TLCK and E-600. The third preparation hydrolysed histone and casein at pH 10.2 and was effectively inhibited by E-600 and partially by protease inhibitors and TPCK. The fourth preparation, resembling cathepsin B1, hydrolysed BANA and BAEE at pH 5.8 and was activated by SH-reagents and EDTA. The fifth enzyme preparation hydrolysed ATEE and was inhibited by E-600 and TPCK. Plasminogen activator was found mainly in the second enzyme preparation and fibrinolysin activity in the third and fifth enzyme preparations. The second, third and fifth enzyme preparations were different from the enzymes found in healthy human skin. The proteases of psoriatic scale resemble those of tissue and cell cultures undergoing rapid cell division. The possible role of proteases in the increased cell division in psoriasis plaque is discussed."

Occasional complications and even death in subjects with sickle cell trait have been attributed to severe physical exertion. However, the extent to which sickling actually occurs during exercise has not been reported. This study examined the red blood cell morphological features immediately following near maximal upright graded bicycle exercise in five asymptomatic black subjects with hemoglobin AS. Exercise produced minimal sickling in vivo, which was not proportional to the intensity of exercise. The amount of sickling in vivo was small in comparison to that observed in the presence of severe hypoxia in vitro, never exceeding 0.75%. in seven normal subjects with hemoglobin AA, exercise did not cause changes in red blood cell morphological features. We conclude that exercise may initiate sickling in subjects with sickle cell trait."

Acidic alpha-mannosidase (EC 3.2.1.24), optimum pH 4.25, is absent from the plasma of Angus calves with mannosidosis, and the residual alpha-mannosidase activity has an optimum pH of 5.5, intermediate between that of the acidic and neutral alpha-mannosidases. This 'intermediate' alpha-mannosidase differs from the acidic form in its kinetic properties, its lack of marked inhibition by EDTA and its thermolability at 55 degrees C and physiological pH. Isoelectric focusing and ion-exchange chromatography show that it exists in at least two forms. The presence of a secondary peak at pH 5.5 in the pH/activity profile of normal plasma and the effect of heating at 55 degrees C indicate that such a form is present in normal plasma. The residual activity in the plasma of a calf with mannosidosis is therefore probably not the product of the defective gene. A differential assay, based on their different stabilities at 55 degrees C, has been developed for measuring the acidic and intermediate alpha-mannosidases in plasma. There was no correlation between the concentrations of the two enzymes in the plasma of Angus cows heterozygous for mannosidosis or in the plasma of normal animals. This precludes the use of the intermediate form as a reference enzyme for the acidic activity in a test for heterozygosity for mannosidosis based on the gene-dosage phenomenon. The concentrations of the intermediate activity were comparable in normal animals and animals homozygous or heterozygous for mannosidosis."

Diclonium bromide (EU-2972; 2-(3,4-dichloroanilino)quinolizinium bromide) was demonstrated to possess an effective, prolonged inhibitory action on contractions in response to stimuli or propulsive movements in the lower bowel of the dog. The compound's antagonism to contractile activity was greater in the distal colon than in the duodenum or upper bowel. Diclonium bromide was a nonselective antispasmodic but, unlike papaverine, caused profound antagonism against smooth muscle contractile responses to intrinsic motor neural excitation. The drug had weak specific anticholinergic action, but its lack of antagonistic effect on other cholinergic responses in this study indicates that the anticholinergic action contributes very little, if at all, to its overall antispasmodic effect. The compound has potential application in the treatment of spastic-colon disease."

This combination of changes is in keeping with the presence of increased proportions of hemoglobin AIc in insulin-treated diabetics. The position of the ODC was positively correlated with the 2,3-DPG concentration (P less than 0.01), which varied in response to fluctuations in plasma concentration of inorganic phosphate (Pi) (P less than 0.001). Optimal metabolic control may lead to a normalization of the ODC in association with increased concentrations of red cell 2,3-DPG and P. When the diabetes was uncontrolled, the ODC was usually unchanged during the acidotic phase because the lowered pH balanced the effect of diminished 2,3-DPG concentration on the ODC. After correction of acidosis, the disproportion between erythrocyte 2,3-DPG and pH became quite prominent, accompanied by a corresponding fall in P50 (21.0 vs. 26.1 mm. Hg, P less than 0.001). Following ketoacidosis, with a persistently lowered Pi, it may take up to one week for 2,3-DPG to return to an approximately normal level, and the P50 will be impaired for the same period. A diphosphonate (EHDP) known to enhance tubular phosphate reabsorption in man was given to nonacidotic insulin-treated diabetic and healthy volunteers for 28 days. It caused a significant increase in mean Pi and P50 in both healthy and diabetic subjects (r = 0.58, P less than 0.01). When a dietary supplement of dibasic calcium phosphate was given to diabetic subjects for 28 days, a significant increase in P50 also occurred (25.2 vs. 27.2 mm. Hg, P less than 0.001). It is recommended that the diabetes diet be supplemented by dibasic calcium phosphate to prevent the inhibitory effect of a low concentration of Pi on red cell oxygen delivery."

The oxygen dissociation curve shifted less to the right in venous blood draining from muscle in eight insulin-deficient diabetics working at a constant submaximal workload than in seven normal controls (28.7 mm. Hg vs. 30.8 mm Hg; P less than 0.05). This diminution of the in-vivo Bohr effect at the muscle tissue level during exercise in diabetics was due to a significantly smaller decrease of venous blood pH (down to 7.33 vs. 7.27 in normals; P less than 0.05), probably a consequence of an latered muscle metabolism in insulin deficiency. Although no glucose was taken up, even during exercise, and less lactate was produced by insulin-deficient muscle (P less than 0.05), the differences in venous blood pH appeared to be brought about mainly by a different CO2 production of the exercising muscle in the two groups. The response of Krebs cycle activity to exercise in insulin-deficient muscle might have been inadequate, as suggested by the increased 3-hydroxybutyrate/acetoacetate ratio in the venous blood observed in the normal controls but not in the diabetics. Furthermore, proportionally less of the arterial ketone body concentration was utilized by the working muscle in the insulin-deficient diabetics. Changes in erythrocyte 2,3-diphosphoglycerate did not contribute to the differences in the in-vivo Bohr effect."

Three months following smallpox vaccination, a child was found to have profound sensory deafness. A medical-legal opinion in 1962 found no relationship between vaccination and deafness. However, when subsequent judgement appeal was made, the legality of the initial decision had to be justified. The consequence of the case, supported by available publication, indicated that a close temporal probability between vaccination and postvaccinial cerebral complication was required to justify any further legal claim. This was not considered to be a factor in the present case since the discovery of a goitre in the patient in association with an iodine dysfunction uncovered a Pendred's syndrome as the cause for the patient's hearing loss."

Patients with atopic dermatitis have abnormal autonomic responses of the arterioles, pilomotor smooth muscle, and sweat glands. Their lesions have been reported to contain increased amounts of the neurohumors, acetylcholine and norepinephrine, as well as increased activity of acetylcholinesterase and catechol-O-methyltransferase. In vitro studies of epidermis show that beta adrenergic agonists fail to evoke the normal inhibition of mitosis of basal cells of patients with atopic dermatitis. Epidermis removed not only from the lesions, but also from normal-appearing skin, responded abnormally. The increase in intracellular levels of cAMP after exposure to catecholamines was similar in normal and atopic epidermis. Lymphocytes and PMN leukocytes isolated from patients with atopic dermatitis show both a decreased physiologic response (glycogenolysis and inhibition of lysosome enzyme release) and a decreased rise in intracellular levels of cAMP upon incubation with beta agonists, but a normal response to PGE1. Cortisol increases the response of lymphocyte adenyl cyclase to both agonists and, in the case of the patients with atopic disease, more than overcomes the depressed response to beta agonists. Because the  leukocytes respond normally to PGE1 and because others have reported normal activities of skin and adenyl cyclase, phosphodiesterase, and protein kinases, we conclude that the step responsible for the diminished beta adrenergic response lies antecedent to the catalytic site of adenyl cyclase."

A sensitive and specific assay for human prolactin has been developed using human prolactin and antiserum distributed by the United States National Pituitary Agency. Plasma prolactin concentrations in control subjects ranged from 0-20 ng/ml. No sex difference in prolactin concentration was observed. A brisk increase in plasma prolactin levels occurred in normal subjects during the administration of chlorpromazine and thyroid stimulating hormone releasing factor (TRH). These stimulatory tests of prolactin release should therefore be useful in the assessment of hypothalamic pituitary function. Basal plasma prolactin values were raised in most patients who were being treated with phenothiazines and were helpful diagnostically in patients with amenorrhoea, galactorrhoea, hypogonadism, cranio-pharyngioma, \"non-functioning\" pituitary tumours and acromegaly. In many of these disorders a significant reduction in the plasma prolactin concentration was observed following oral administration of bromocriptine. Plasma prolactin determinations should be useful in evaluating the response to medical treatment or pituitary ablation."

The kinetic inhibition of the gelation of hemoglobin S is compared to the change in hemoglobin S soulbility, when the solubility is altered by carbon monoxide, pH, or urea. By means of a new technique, the delay time and the extent of gelation are measured on the same sample. They delay time, td, is found to be proportional to a high power (30-40) of the hemoglobin S solubility. Togehter with the previously reported concentration dependence, this result demonstrates that the rate is proportional to a high power of the supersaturation, S, defined as the ratio of the total hemoglobin S concentration to the equilibrium solubility. The results obey the supersaturation equation td-1 = gammaSn, where gamma is an empirical constant (about 10(-7) sec-1) and n is about 35. The supersaturation equation can successfully account for observations on the kinetics of cell sickling and is therefore used to estimate the increase in the delay time for sickling necessary to produce significant clinical benefit to patients with sickle cell disease."

In a study of groups of patients with atopic (extrinsic) asthma, non-atopic (intrinsic) asthma, and chronic bronchitis, no difference could be detected in the numbers having precipitating antibodies against species specific antigens from Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pneumoniae compared to suitably matched control subjects. Precipitating antibodies against species specific antigens from Haemophilus influenzae, demonstrated in this investigation by double diffusion in agar gel, were found much more frequently in patients with chronic mucopurulent or obstructive bronchitis (50%) than in either asthmatic subjects (6%) or normal controls (6%) (P = less than 0.0005). While the precipitating antibody demonstrated in these patients against the extracts of Str. pneumoniae and Staph. aureus was in the IgG class alone, IgM and IgA antibody were detected against the species specific but not the non-species specific antigens of H. influenzae. These results underline the importance of H. influenzae as an infecting agent in chronic bronchitis and suggest that the finding of precipitins against the species specific H1 and H2 antigens of this bacterium denotes infection either concurrently or in the recent past. There is no evidence to suggest from this study that infection with Staph. aureus, Str. pneumoniae or H. influenzae is any more common in asthmatics as a group compared to controls or between patients with the non-atopic (intrinsic) and atopic (extrinsic) form of the disease."

We measured transthoracic electrical impedance in 17 anesthetized and mechanically ventilated dogs with a four-electrode system. A current (5 KHZ, 50 mu A) is injected and detected at axillary levels. Transthoracic impedance was 67 +/- 14 ohms (S.D.) with insignificant shifts in control animals. Pulmonary edemas were induced by saline and dextrose overloads with large but opposite variations in impedance. Fifty to hundred per cent increases in total lung water content (determined at autopsy) were induced by intravenous injection of alloxan or instillation of endotracheal saline. Significant but small decreases in impedance followed. Validity of experimental pulmonary edemas with or without blood resistivity and pulmonary blood volume changes is discussed."

It is a major complication of overdoses (48 p. 100 of severe intoxications). Their formation can be suspected, when after the first phase of respiratory depressions, with coma, myosis, and a variable latent period, a second attack of respiratory insufficiency occurs with tachypnea, and cyanosis. The chest X-ray shows diffuse alveolar infiltration, sparing the apices. The heart being generally of normal size. Rapid disappearance of this infiltrate (24 to 48 hours) enables the elimination of two diagnoses: pneumonia due to inhalation of gastric fluid, an infectious pneumonia. Their pathogenesis remains very debatable: - in the majority of cases abrupt L.V.F. can be eliminated: -on the other hand it could be an allergic accident of the anaphylactic type, or local liberation of histamine, or a local toxic action on the pulmonary capillaries; - hypoxia, secondary to respiratory depression, could lead to pulmonary edema, by the same mechanism as at altitude; - finally, owing to the central neurological disorders a neurogenic theory can be put forward.

Fifty-three patients with scleroderma were evaluated by history, barium swallow, and esophageal function tests. The most common esophageal symptoms were heartburn and dysphagia. Abnormal motility was seen radiologically in 43 patients, gastroesophageal reflux in only 9. Esophageal function tests demonstrated: (1) abnormal motility in 51 patients and lack of a distal esophageal high-pressure zone in 18; (2) moderate to severe gastroesophageal reflux in 38; and (3) abnormal acid-clearing ability in 50. Eleven patients, including 8 with peptic stricture, underwent the combined Collis-Belsey operation. Symptomatically, reflux was abolished in all and dysphagia in 10. Roentgenograms showed that regression of strictures was complete in 5 and partial in 3. Postoperative esophageal function tests in 9 patients demonstrated a competent distal esophageal valvular mechanism in 7. Gastroesophageal reflux, not impaired motility, is the major cause of esophageal symptoms in scleroderma. Its effecitve operative control is not contraindicated by systemic disease in these patients."

By reducing the chances of fatal hypoxemia, ECMO allowed treatment to be instituted for this potentially reversible disorder and proved helpful as a form of support during the management of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis when severe hypoxemia may have other wise precluded bronchopulmonary lavage."

I have tried to bring out some of the important methodological problems found in examining the effectiveness of drugs used in the control of druginduced parkinsonism by referring mainly to studies in which I have taken part. I hope I have shown that the whole topic is far less well understood than is often assumed. The main points may be summarized as follows: there is doubt as to whether many of the drugs used in controlling drug-induced parkinsonism are really effective; the results of many studies are conflicting; many studies contain serious flaws in design; methods for assessing extrapyramidal signs are not well developed; we are ignorant of the way in which drug-induced extrapyramidal signs change spontaneously. There is a clear need for further research in this area to improve techniques of assessment, to provide basic information on drug-induced syndromes, and to rigorously examine the efficacy of the drugs used in controlling them."

The cause for his negative anion gap is thought to be the myeloma protein, which acts as a cation at physiological pH. Such a hyponatremia responds to reduction in serum concentration of paraprotein and should not be treated by sodium replacement."

As to the basal condition, acid output couldn't be measured by the telemetering method in most cases because of high pH value in the stomach. There was no definite relation between two methods. On the other hand, acid output from the telemetering after stimulation of AOC-tetragastrin (4 gamma/kg, s.c.) showed a good reproducibility and good correlation with that from the aspiration method (r = +0.86). And the difference between two methods could be explained from the fact that some volume of secreted acid escaped into the duodenum before being neutralized by potassium bicarbonate, and that some of gastric juice remained not aspirated in the stomach."

Isoelectric focusing of purified band II from which SDS has been removed reveals heterogeneity. Band II migrates as multiple bands on isoelectric focusing gels and as a single band on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The increased phosphorylation in DMD does not occur uniformly in all components of band II. Highly phosphorylated components of band II are present in DMD in which only minimal phosphorylation occurs in controls. These results suggest the presence of an abnormal band II substrate in erythrocyte membranes from DMD patients."

Sodium para-aminosalicylate (sodium salt of 2-hydroxy-4-aminobenzoic acid, Na-PAS) lowers the oxygen affinity of normal adult human placental, heterozygous and homozygous sickle cell anemic whole blood at 37 degrees C. The reduction of oxygen affinity is related to the type of hemoglobin in the blood. The mean P50 +/- S.E. at pH 7.40 for normal, placental, heterozygoud and homozygous sickle cell anemic blood in 26.2 +/- 0.1, 20.8 +/- 0.3, 26.8 +/- 0.3 and 31.0 +/- 0.5 mm Hg; in the presence of 5.7 mmol of Na-PAS per liter of blood the P50 values are increased to 28.0 +/- 0.3, 22.9 +/- 0.8, 30.5 +/- 0.6 and 33.9 +/- 0.3 mm Hg, respectively. The Bohr effect in normal and placental blood at this Na-PAS concentration is essentially unchanged: in heterozygous and homozygous sickle cell anemic blood, the Bohr factor (deta log P50/deta pH) is reduced from -0.48 +/- 0.02 to -0.41 +/- 0.01 and from -0.53 +/- 0.03 to -0.48 +/- 0.01. The Hill constants (n) of normal and placental blood are not affected by Na-PAS. In homozygous and heterozygous sickle blood, high concentrations of Na-PAS (22.9 mmol/l) decrease the Hill constant from 2.55 to 2.35 and from 2.56 to 2.28, respectively. Na-PAS is more firmly bound to red blood cells than to plasma. The binding of Na-PAS is probably primarily ionic in nature since the drug can be almost completely removed from blood components by dialysis. The changes in oxygen affinity caused by Na-PAS are consistent with conformational changes (R leads to T) which enhance the presence of deoxyhemoglobin."

In addition, the mean number of days withdrawn and patients' satisfaction rating are measured. The statistical method can correct for initial imbalances between groups and allows for the valid comparison of drugs from separate trials. Ten antirheumatic medications were evaluated using this technique in 684 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and the results are in agreement with those of previous studies using standard clinical methods. The new method is simple, rapid in performance, economical in terms of cost and time, and has been shown to be sensitive and reproducible.

Histamine H2-receptor antagonists, including burimamide, metiamide and cimetidine, are effective antagonists of histamine-stimulated acid secretion from mammalian, avian or reptilian gastric mucosa. Acid secretion stimulated by gastrin or pentagastrin is also inhibited by these drugs, but there is disagreement about the effects of these drugs on acid secretion resulting from activation of acetylcholine receptors. Based on the pharmacological evidence possibilities of treatment by these drugs were discussed in cases with excessive stimulation of acid secretion due to high blood levels of histamine or gastrin. The positive results in several trials on Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and peptic ulcer were very impressive. Some practical problems have still to be solved, for example the appropriate phase for applying the drugs. The demonstrated clinical effectiveness, however, against peptic ulceration offers a clear alternative to surgery for many patients."

The reduction in acid secretion is profound and may approach the degree of reduction brought about by gastric surgery. The H2-receptor antagonist metiamide, administered orally, has been used successfully in the treatment of duodenal ulcer and the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, but it has been shown to cause agranulocytosis.

The LAL activity (mean+/-SD) of peripheral leukocytes obtained from 34 laboratory volunteers (19 females, 15 males) was 4.0+/-1.8. Partially purified lymphocytes contained about 25 times as much LAL activity as did granulocytes. Cellogel electrophoresis, followed by staining with 4-MUO, showed at least two bands of LAL (A and B) from normal fibroblasts, amniotic fluid cells, and lymphocytes. Band A was absent from WD and CESD fibroblasts and was reduced in fibroblasts of the WD heterozygotes."

Diagnosis was obtained during life by percutaneous renal biopsy in 5 patients and muscular or cutaneous biopsy in 2 other patients, whereas the evidence was only obtained on post mortem examination in the 2 remaining patients. In the 6 renal biopsies examined by immunofluorescence, fibrinogen was always present in glomeruli and/or arteries. In one patient there was a linear deposit of IgG along glomerular basement membrane (GBM) and there were circulating antibodies directed against GBM. Arteries of different sizes may be damaged in various organs, as showed by arteriography and autopsy. Steroid therapy and immunosuppressive drugs had no effect on renal symptoms. 8 out of 9 patients died rapidly, in 6 the death was due to extrarenal localization of the disease, even though uraemia was controlled by haemodialysis. The last patient died 2 years after onset of the disease, while being on maintenance haemodialysis treatment."

    "abstract": "Malaria of the orang-utan (Pongo pygmaeus) in Borneo. The primary objective of this project was to study the life cycle and ecology of Plasmodium pitheci, a malaria parasite of the orang-utan. The field work was based on the orang-utan rehabilitation centre in the Sepilok Forest Reserve of eastern Sabah. Two visits were made to Sepilok, the first in February and March, 1972, and the second (by W.P.) in January 1974. On the first visit two species of \"surrogate host\" were taken to Sabah, i.e. chimpanzees and Aotus monkeys for experimental work. The arboreal habitat of the orang-utan in the dipterocarp forests of eastern Sabah is described. In the Sepilok Forest Reserve dwell gibbons and leaf-monkeys, in addition to a small population of semi-domesticated and wild, free-ranging orang-utans of various ages. Although numerous species of anopheline mosquitoes have been collected in eastern Sabah, longitudinal studies are not available. Anopheles balabacensis was caught both attracted to orang-utans and to man at Sepilok. This species which is the main vector of human malaria in the north of Borneo, is suspected also of transmitting orang-utan malaria in this part of Sabah. Repeated blood examinations have been made on a number of orang-utans in the centre since 1966 and a high prevalence of infection was recorded with Plasmodium pitheci. In 1966 10 out of 19 animals had demonstrable parasitaemia. Detailed case histories are presented to show the course of parasitaemia in several orang-utans. Infections of P. pitheci were found to run a very chronic course. During the 1972 expedition a second, previously undescribed malaria parasite of the orang-utan was discovered, and was named P. silvaticum. The new parasite was successfully transmitted both by blood inoculation and, later, by sporozoite inoculation, into splenectomized chimpanzees. Although both species of malaria parasite may cause transitory signs of illness, orang-utans in general appear to be little discomforted by the infection. The animals do however suffer from other infectious diseases such as amoebic and balantidial dysentery, and melioidosis is a serious natural hazard which may have accounted for several deaths of wild orang-utans. An unidentified, intraerythrocytic structure that appeared in the blood of one chimpanzee, which had been inoculated with blood from an orang-utan, may have contributed to its death. Detailed descriptions and illustrations of P. pitheci and P. silvaticum are given. All stages of the life cycle of P. silvaticum are known (the tissue stages having been described in the liver of a \"surrogate host\", the chimpanzee) but only the blood and sporogonic stages of P. pitheci have been seen. This species was not infective to a chimpanzee, although there is an earlier report of a transient infection in this host by other workers. In the blood both parasites showed a tertian periodicity. From the appearance of the tissue schizonts on the seventh day it was estimated that the complete pre-erythrocytic cycle of P. silvaticum in the chimpanzee would occupy 8 days. P..."

Blood pressure (BP), plasma renin concentration (PRC), plasma renin substrate concentration (PRSC) and exchangeable sodium (ES) have been studied in 27 patients undergoing regular hemodialysis because of end-stage renal disease. PRC was significantly higher in the hypertensive than in the normotensive patients. The pattern of PRSC was similar in the groups of patients but with a marked individual variation. ES was slightly lower in the hypertensives than in the normotensives but the difference was not statistically significant. Multiple regression analysis demonstrated a significant correlation between mean BP, the natural logarithm of PRC and ES, but the effect of ES was negligible. PRC was negatively correlated to ES in all patients, including the hypertensives. These results strongly suggest that the renin-angiotensin system is the most important factor involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension in end-stage renal disease, when sodium balance is adequately controlled. A clinical application of the predictive value of PRC concerning the effect of bilateral nephrectomy on hypertension is outlined."

Respiratory distress due to laryngeal obstruction produces a more or less dramatic syndrome depending on the cause of the obstruction and its evolution in time. Treatment should be immediate in order to avoid death or cerebral and cardiac sequelae. It consists, above all, of restoring the patency of the respiratory tract, the short-circuit obtained by intubation or tracheotomy should, in no case, leave any laryngeal sequelae. The authors present their personal series based on a study of respiratory distress due to laryngeal obstruction in the child. These observations were obtained from a large series of 480 cases of laryngeal dyspnea observed over the last 5 years on the E.N.T. unit of the Edouard Herriot Hospital in Lyons. They contrast a very small number of sub-glottic laryngitis cases requiring intubation or tracheotomy to a very large number of cases of subglottic laryngitis, even with respiratory distress, which recovered with well designed medical treatment. Foreign bodies, of which they report eleven cases, all required emergency surgery. They emphasize the severity of this cause. As far as papillomas and angiomas are concerned, they require emergency treatment, either straightaway or after a trial of medical treatment."

Pre-existing disease in the form of hypertension or ischaemic heart disease may increase morbidity and mortality in patients presenting for anaesthesia and surgery. The interaction of these two cardiovascular conditions in relation to anaesthesia has been studied in a series of 115 patients. The results did not support the view that antihypertensive drugs and beta-receptor blocking agents should be withdrawn before anaesthesia and surgery. The main cause for concern in providing anaesthesia for these patients is that sympathetic nervous activation induced either by anaesthetic manoeuvres or by surgical stimulation may lead to reflex cardiovascular responses which, by increasing myocardial oxygen demand, lead to episodes of myocardial ischaemia. In this respect beta-receptor blocking drugs appear to have a protective effect on the ischaemic myocardium."

Beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) may be less effective in the treatment of patients with angina pectoris than some others that lack this property. A review of 14 trials comparing beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug with ISA and those without ISA in angina pectoris has been made. The overall picture emerges from both acute and chronic studies using subjective and objective endpoints, that there is no striking difference in effectiveness between the two kinds of beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs. The one exception is pindolol (a drug with ISA) which, at higher doses, has been shown to be consistently worse than propranolol (a drug without ISA). The reasons for the similarity between propranolol and other bets-blocking drugs with ISA in the trials cited are either that the trial design was defective (the trials were mainly fixed dose comparisons) or that the stimulant effects of those drugs with ISA is not of sufficient magnitude to make a difference. It is suggested that further carefully constructed clinical trials should be carried out before the second reason can be accepted."

The abnormal hemoglobin shows heat instability and a lowered oxygen affinity. The substitution of a large charged arginine residue for the small glycine residue in the G helix next to a heme contact (Leu-106) may be responsible for these effects. Hb Burke is compared with five other hemoglobins having Gly-Arg substitutions in other parts of the molecule."

However, the beneficial effect of such a pregrafting procedure is limited to the prevention of acute GvHD. The late GvHD remains a continuing problem, and is probably due to the graft-versus-host activity (GvHA) of newly produced nontolerant lymphocytes from lymphoid precursors resistant to ATS. Possible ways to render these precursors sensitive to ATS and complement are discussed. The potential significance of thymic hormones and cyclic AMP in achieving this is emphasized."

Antiarrhythmic property of a new adrenergic beta-blocking agent, dl-1-(tert.butylamino)-3[(2-propinyloxy) phenoxy]-2-propanol hydrochloride (Kö 1400-Cl) was studied, using 1) ouabain-induced arrhythmia in the guinea pig, 2) aconitine-induced arrhythmia in the rat, 3) arrhythmia induced by two-step ligation of coronary artery (Harris's method) in the dog and 4) halothane-adrenaline arrhythmia in the dog and was compared with those of propranolol, oxprenolol, procainamide and ajmaline. Procainamide and ajmaline produced a marked protective effect against aconitine-induced ventricular extrasystole, but were not so effective against aconitine-induced ventricular fibrillation, while oxprenolol and, to a lesser degree, propranolol were effective against the latter type of aconitine arrhythmias. Kö 1400-Cl proved to be ineffective. All the compounds tested produced a marked protective action against ouabain-arrhythmia. Whereas procainamide was most effective in abolishing the ventricular arrhythmia due to coronary-ligation even on the first postoperative day, Kö 1400-Cl and propranolol were almost ineffective on the first day. Even on the second postoperative day, the antiarrhythmic effects of these two beta-blockers were not remarkable, effective only in 2/4 animals in the case of Kö 1400-Cl and in 2/3 animals in the case of propranolol. On the contrary, all the beta-blockers tested produced a protective action against halothane-adrenaline arrhythmia at much lower doses than against coronary ligation arrhythmia. The potency ratio of Kö 1400-Cl and propranolol was 3 : 1, which paralleled with beta-blocking activity of these compounds."

Female patients and those with organic brain pathology more frequently exhibited Parkinsonism (although the difference was not statistically significant). No correlation was found between duration of treatment and extrapyramidal effects. Of the 40 patients who developed Parkinsonism, 25 responded favourably to orphenadrine, while six (15%) had more marked manifestations on orphenadrine than on placebo."

Schizophrenia may be associated with increased prostaglandin synthesis in certain parts of the brain. This hypothesis is based on the following findings: (1) Catalepsy, which is the nearest equivalent in animals to human catatonia, develops in cats when prostaglandin E1 is injected into the cerebral ventricles and when during endotoxin or lipid A fever the prostaglandin E2 level in cisternal c.s.f. rises to high levels; however, when fever and prostaglandin level are brought down by non-steroid anti-pyretics which inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, catalepsy disappears as well. (2) Febrile episodes are a genuine syndrome of schizophrenia."

    "abstract": "Splenomegaly in Northern Nigeria. Seventy five patients with large spleens were investigated in order to establish the causes of splenomegaly in Northern Nigeria, to define further the diagnostic criteria of tropical splenomegaly syndrome (TSS), and to study its pathogenesis. Investigations included examination of liver biopsy, bone marrow cytology, lymphocyte response to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), serum immunoglobulins and complement, and the presence of immunoglobulin and complement fixed in Kupffer cells. Thirty patients had TSS, five chronic lymphatic leukaemia (CLL), four a syndrome of gross lymphoid hyperplasia (GLH) distinct from TSS, CLL and the lymphomas, and twenty three miscellaneous conventional diseases. In thirteen cases no definite diagnosis could be established. TSS was found to be predominantly a disease of female Fulani cattle herders. Its essential characteristics were splenomegaly in the presence of acquired immunity to malaria, a grossly raised serum IgM, a lowered serum complement, and the presence of IgM fixed in Kupffer cells. There was lymphoid hyperplasia in bone marrow, hepatic sinusoids and often blood which may be indistinguishable from that in CLL. Lymphocytes undergo normal blastogenesis to PHA. There was clinical and haematological response to proguanil therapy. Reticuloendothelial phagocytosis of IgM, probably as a complex, seems to be the essential feature of the condition. As it was impossible to identify early cases of TSS it is unclear whether IgM overproduction or phagocytosis of IgM complexes is the first stage of the disease. The precise nature of the association with malaria remains obscure. The diagnosis of CLL demanded the demonstration of an abnormally low immunoglobulin level and impaired lymphocyte responsiveness to PHA by blast transformation or 3H-thymidine incorporation, in addition to the usual haematological findings. The syndrome GLH occurred in multiparous Hausa women. It was characterised by intense lymphocytosis with active, PHA-responsive cells, and normal immunoglobulin levels. Patients responded to proguanil therapy. It is suggested that these patients have a depressed immune response to malaria, perhaps through repeated pregnancies, and to a leukaemogenic agent, both of which stimulate lymphocytosis. Antimalarial treatment at this stage may prevent the development of frank leukaemia or lymphoma. The usefulness of the various investigative procedures and the problem of managing the large number of undiagnosed cases are discussed."

Sulfasalazine alone was used in 24 patients, steroids alone were used in four patients, both drugs were used together in 29 patients and azathioprine was added to the drug regimen of five patients. The initial choice of drug followed a set design but the regimens ultimately arrived at depended upon patient responses. Favorable complete or partial clinical responses were obtained in 54 patients, while 37 patients showed objective radiographic improvement or regression. No radiographic improvement was found in the eight patients with clinical treatment failure as well as in 11 patients with clinical improvement. Six clinically improved patients had not yet been re-examined radiographically. The study provides objective evidence that the majority of patients with Crohn's disease can be successfully treated by means of anti-inflammatory drugs."

Analysis of body height was performed in the control group of 500 well-fertile men and in 829 patients with various forms of testicular pathology such as hypoplasia of testicles, unilateral and bilateral cryptorchism, hypogonadotrophic eunuchodism, and Klinefelter's syndrome. A statistically greater average height was found in bilateral cryptorchids, unilateral cryptorchids with an adequate spermiogenesis, hypogonadotrophic eunuchoids and chromatin-positive men. The greatest difference, when compared with the control group, was found in patients with a Klinefelter's syndrome.

Forty-nine patients with severe aplastic anemia, 33 due to unknown cause, 11 drug or chemical related, 2 associated with hepatitis, 1 with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, and 2 possibly associated with Fanconi syndrome did not show recovery after 0.5-96 (median 2) mo of conventional therapy. Twenty-two were infected and 21 were refractory to random platelet transfusions at the time of admission. All were given marrow grafts from HLA-identical siblings. Forty-five were conditioned for grafting by cyclophosphamide (CY), 50 mg/kg on each of 4 successive days, and four by 1000 rad total body irradiation. All were given intermittent methotrexate therapy within the first 100 days of grafting to modify graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Three patients died from infection too early to evaluate (days 1-8). Forty-six had marrow engraftment. Of these, 20 are surviving with good peripheral blood counts between 186 and 999 days, and 18 have returned to normal activities. Chronic GCHD is a problem in five. Twelve patients died of infection following rejection of the marrow graft. Twelve patients died with bacterial or fungal infections or interstitial pneumonia and active GVHD or soon following resolution of GVHD. Two patients died with marrow engraftment and no GVHD, one with an interstitial, and the other with a bacterial pneumonia. Thirty-six patients who had received random donor blood transfusions were randomly assigned to receive either CY or procarbazine-antithymocyte globulin-CY as conditioning regimens to test whether the incidence of graft rejection could be decreased. There was no difference in the incidence of graft rejection between the two regimens. In 13 patients with rejection, second transplants were attempted either with the original marrow donor (9 patients) or another HLA-identical sibling (4 patients). Three of these transplants were not evaluable, seven were unsuccessful and three were successful with only one of the three surviving for more than 468 days. In conclusion, the long-term survival of 41% of the patients in the present study is similar to that achieved in our first 24 patients, and confirms the importance of marrow transplantation for the treatment of severe aplastic anemia. Marrow graft rejection, GVHD, and infections continue to be the major causes of failure."

Fifty-six brains from middle-aged and elderly normal as well as demented subjects and patients with provisional clinical diagnosis of other neurological and psychiatric diseases were assessed histologically. On this basis the specimens were classified into 14 diagnostic groups. A survey of potential indices of specific neurons has been carried out on these brains in which neurotransmitter-related enzymes, gamma-GTP (a potential index of capillaries) and specific proteins have been determined in up to 20 brain regions. In addition, the agonal state has been tentatively assessed by examining the post-mortem states of the circulatory and respiratory systems. CAT and gamma-GTP activities and the concentration of a soluble neuronal-type protein (neuronin S-5) were found to be relatively unaffected by the agonal state. When cases of senile dementia were compared to controls (matched with respect to the cause of death) the activity of CAT (the potential index of cholinergic neurons) appears to be reduced in the cerebral cortex. This is a preliminary finding, although a correlation was indicated between CAT activity and 'senile' morphological changes, the activity was markedly reduced in only 3 brains. However, despite inconsistencies in the literature (Karczmar, 1975) at least one pharmacological study on humans appears to show that the cholinergic system may be involved in age-related memory degeneration (Drachman and Leavitt, 1974). Cholinergic neurons may be abnormal in the other abiotrophies examined (Huntington's chorea, motor neuron disease and mixed vascular and senile dementia). gamma-GTP and neuronin S-5 (identical in most respects to the soluble acidic neuronal protein 14-3-2 of antigen alpha) were not reduced in senile dementia. The activities of brain decarboxylase (GAD and AAD) and the concentration of another soluble acidic brain protein (neuronin S-6) appear to be affected by the agonal state. This is remarkable because GAD and, in particular, neuronin S6, are relatively unaffected by post-mortem autolysis. As judged by the state of the extraneural systems which regulated the blood and oxygen supply to the brain it appears that terminal 'cerebral hypoxia' is responsible for the depletion of these brain constituents. This effect appears to be particularly marked in deep grey matter. In non-demented patients that die of bronchopneumonia, the areas of the cortex which are depleted in neuronin S-6 are consistent with the pattern of the 'selective vulnerability' of the cortex to hypoxia, suggesting that the terminal state can also affect the neocortex. If so, then this is particularly relevant to studies on senile dementia, for the effect of the terminal bronchopneumonia that so often occurs in these patients (and in patients with other abiotrophies) may be exacerbated by a terminal reduction in cerebral blood flow..."

The primary metabolic defect in 5-oxoprolinuria is a generalized deficiency of glutathione synthetase. The activity of this enzyme was determined in cell-free extracts of erythrocytes from patients with 5-oxoprolinuria, their parents and a sibling as well as from normal control individuals. The following activities (pkat/mg of hemoglobin) for glutathione synthetase were obtained: homozygotes mean 0.10 (range 0.07-0.12), heterozygotes mean 3.1 (range 2.8-3.7) and control individuals mean 6.1 (range 5.4-6.7). These results indicate that 5-oxoprolinuria, i.e. the defective gluthione synthetase gene(s), is transmitted by autosomal recessive inheritance. Studies of the kinetics of the low remaining activity of erythrocyte glutathione synthetase in patients with 5-oxoprolinuria failed to reveal defective affinity for glycine, gamma-glutamyl-alpha-aminobutyrate, ATP and Mg2+ ions. Furthermore, the pH optimum, time curves and temperature dependence for the mutant enzyme activity did not significantly differ from the corresponding parameters observed with normal enzyme."

A pubertal increase of the testosterone plasma level was found to begin in subjects with cryptorchidism or Klinefelter's syndrome at a similar age as in the control group. However, as early as at the age of 13 to 14 years decreased testosterone values were found in the patients as compared to normal juveniles. Between 19 and 20 years, the plasma testosterone level was significantly decreased in all patient-groups as compared to the controls of similar age. In adulthood, plasma testosterone concentrations in the patient groups were observed to be 4 to 6 ng/ml without significant age-dependent changes, which are characteristic of normospermic males. Different degrees of clinical symptoms indicating androgen deficiency found in various patient groups despite similar androgen levels in adulthood suggest a different responsiveness of their target organs to androgens."

The substituted benzylamin-derivative fominoben (PB 89 Noleptan) was intravenously administered to 12 patients with chronic obstructive lung disease in order to determine, whether an analeptic action on respiration, which had been found by others in animal studies and in healthy subjects, can also be demonstrated in patients with COLD. Time ventilation showed no statistically significant change. Respiratory rate was increased for a short time, alveolar ventilation showed a slight but significant increase 35 minutes after i.v. injection of fominoben, however no significant change in the first 10 minutes after injection.--Arterial pO2 was slightly but not significantly increased in the first 10 minutes after fominoben, while the same patients showed a significant decrease of pO2 after injection of placebo. As alveolar ventilation at this time had not significantly changed, the increase in pO2 can only be explained by an improvement of regional ventilation-perfusion ratio by fominoben. -In conclusion it can be stated, that a marked stimulative action on respiration by fominoben could not be demonstrated. There was, however, no depression of respiration as it is associated with most other caugh medications. As the drug has been shown to be an excellent caugh sedative, lack of respiratory depression can be considered as a considerable advantage."

NADPH oxidase activity was examined in paired 27,000 x g granule fractions isolated from normal polymorphonuclear leukocytes from patients with chronic granulomatous disease. At 0.17 mM NADPH, the oxidase activity was not measurable in normal resting cells but was activated by phagocytosis. This activation was absent in CGD cells. At higher levels of NADPH, activity was present in cells from patients with CGD, although it was lower than normal, and no difference in activity was found between resting and phagocytizing cells. Granule fractions from phagocytizing normal cells exhibited higher than granule fractions from resting normal cells at all levels of NADPH. These results suggest that NADPH oxidase activity is defective in chronic granulomatous disease, and further that the defect is not the absence of the enzyme but rather a failure to activate it."

Environmental rather than genetic factors appear to be responsible for the causation of cancers involving epithelial surfaces, especially oropharyngeal cancers, cancers of the gastro-intestinal tract, cancers of the liver and gall-bladder, cancers of the cervix uteri and lung cancers. Epithelial surfaces which have mucus-bearing cells are particularly prone, because if these mucus cells are surrounded by an alkaline milieu over a prolonged period, the mucous of the epithelial cells is rendered fluid and is removed from the cells, of which it forms an integral part. This leads to proliferative changes with metaplasia, cell-atypia and a very significant increase in mitotic activity. Such changes are a prelude to carcinogenesis.

The subsepsis allergica should be regarded as a subseptic first stage of the Still syndrome. The Still-syndrome implies a systemic disease mainly of the reticulo-endothelial system, with carditis, nephropathy, recurrent erythemas, and a progressing polyarthritis. Later symptoms are amyloidosis, chronic nephritis, myo- and pericarditis, and artheriitis necroticans. Predominanly the involvement of the kidneys is the reasons for the high mortality rate of 13%. Chronic polyarthritis in the strict sense is similar in children and adults, though in children rheumatic factors are rarely detected. The exsudative form of arthritis tends to cause early deterioration. Joint symptoms are distributed asymmetrically and show locally inflammed growth otherwise less common in Still-syndrome. Spondylitis cervicalis rapidly causes ankylosis. Atlanto-axial-arthritis with consequent atlanto-axial dislocation can be the reason for neurological disturbances. Juvenile mono- or oligo-arthritis often turns into polyarthritis; but for joints the prognosis is more favourable. In contrast, rheumatoid iridocyclitis as found in 22% of the cases causes unfavourable complications because symptoms are not noticed in time so that treatment is often too late. Juvenile spondylitis ankylosans begins with a peripheral arthritic stage which is not easily distinguished from chronic polyarthritis. The male sex, mono- or oligoarthritis of the outer extremities, pain in the heel, atlanto-axial-arthritis, iridocyclitis, and a positive HLA of 27 give a diagnostic clue. -- Characteristics of the therapy will be discussed."

    "abstract": "[Clinical evaluation of oxypertine in anxiety conditions]. Oxypertine, a new anxiolytic drug related to the indolylazine compounds, was evaluated in a group of 30 patients, the majority with severe anxiety (acute or chronic) : in some cases depression was associated. The study was performed in the Psychiatric Department at the Centro Femenil de Rehabilitación Social, in Mexico City. A special feature of this study was that patients were confined for a legal process and consequently with restricted liberty. All were females between 19 to 44 years old, with an average age of 32.05 years. The methodology applied in this case was a modified double blind randomized procedure, using different color capsules with placebo or the active drug (yellow oxypertine and blue placebo). Patients received a 10 mg capsule every 12 hours (20 mg daily). The clinical measurement of anxiety was performed using the Visual Anxiety Scale (Murphy), evaluating each of its 11 parameters. The intensity was qualified from 0 to 3; at the end of each consultation a global assessment was made. Most of the patients were interviewed in five occasions during the treatment period. For each of the nine patients receiving during 4 weeks only oxypertine capsules (group I), the scores of the parameters of the scale were added, observing the following results: in seven excellent respond, fair in one and one abandoned the study since the beginning. In eight of the patients who received placebo (group II) also for a 4 weeks period, results were evaluated as follows: five excellent one good and two poor. It can be observed that both groups gave a similar final score at the end of the study, meaning that no significant benefits were obtained between the active drug and the placebo, in spite that anxiety decreased in most of them. In group III, seven cases initiated with placebo and after 2 weeks the capsule had to be changed to oxypertine due to stablization or increase in the anxiety. Results were excellent in three, good in two, poor in one and another case suspended the treatment when placebo was to be substituted. In this same group, six cases initiated treatment with oxypertine, and after two weeks or more the medication was changed to placebo due to the same reasons mentioned above. Results were fair in one and poor in five. A significant response was observed in those cases where oxypertine replaced placebo and no response was obtained when placebo substituted oxypertine. Few cases abandoned mainly for two reasons: satisfactory remission of the anxiety or symptoms exacerbation. Investigators emphasize that the psychological conditions of the patients studied in this trial were different from the ones who ordinarily assist to the out patient clinics or private practice, mainly because were subjects with legal and social problems, as already mentioned, confined in a rehabilitation center. The conclusion of the stldy is that the administration of oxpertine at the dosage of 20 mg to patients with severe anxiety and with the special conditions mentioned above, provides a relative anxiolytic effect."

There is evidence that changes in the concentrations of the monoamine neurotransmitters within the brain are associated with changes in mental processes, with disorders of control of movement and with certain neuropsychiatric diseases. These neurotransmitters are synthesized in the brain from aromatic amino acid precursors that have to be obtained from the circulating blood. In this study some factors which alter the rates of entry of four amino acids (the important neurotransmitter precursors L-tyrosine and L-tryptophan, as well as L-phenylalanine and L-histidine) into the brain have been studied and the findings considered in relation to conditions in which the quantities of one or more of the monoamine neurotransmitters formed within the cerebral cells may be either too large or too small. Thus too little neurotransmitter will be formed if competition between amino acids for the carriers transporting them into the cerebral cells causes the exclusion of a large proportion of any of the aromatic amino acid precursors from the brain. ,or example, L-tryptophan is partially excluded from the brain if a raised level of any one of several other amino acids is maintained in the circulation. Of these, L-phenylalanine inhibits the transport of L-tryptophan into the brain most effectively, while aromatic amino acids in general exclude L-tryptophan more effectively than do other neutral amino acids. Over-production of one or more of the monoamine neurotransmitters is likely to occur when there is too much of one of the aromatic amino acid precursors in the brain cells as a result of abnormally high uptake from the blood, or as a result of their release by an excessive breakdown of the protein within these cells. Underproduction of neurotransmitters may occur in certain disease states, such as some aminoacidurias or Parkinsonism. We have listed some conditions associated with altered mental states or motor disability in which over- or under-production of monoamine neurotransmitters may occur and have tried to relate the findings in human disease with our experimental results."

A sequential analysis was made of various areas within the lymph nodes and spleen of newborn Brown Norway (BN) rats suffering from graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) subsequent to an allogeneic injection of adult Lewis (L) lymph node cells (experimental). One micron thick autoradiographs were compared between such experimental and control littermates having received the same number of syngeneic adult BN cells. Both experimental and control animals received tritiated deoxythymidine (3HdT) one hour before killing. The autoradiographs revealed a 2.25 and 2.50 times higher thymidine labeling index of lymphocytes in the deep cortex of mesenteric lymph nodes and white pulp of the spleen, respectively, for experimental animals. The experimental effect occurred within one day. The majority of the labeled cells in experimental animals were large lymphoblasts with prominent nucleoli. The labeling index within these areas remained significantly higher than control values until day 8 in the spleen and through day 14 within the lymph nodes. However, differences in labeled cells present in high powered microscopic fields reached a peak on day 3 within compartments in experimental animals but fell significantly below control values by day 9 owing to a pronounced disappearance of both small and large lymphocytes from these areas, and a decreased intensity of individual cell labeling as the reaction progressed. In contradistinction the concentration of labeled cells present in high powered microscopic fields of lymph nodes' medulla became 3.13 times controls by day 4. Most of these labeled cells contained a more basophilic cytoplasm than those found in the deep cortex and some were distinctly plasma cell precursors. In contrast to the deep cortex their concentration remained approximately three times control values until death. The data indicates that the major proliferative events within the spleen and lymph nodes in neonatal rat GVHD are initially restricted to donor cell localization areas of these tissue compartments. Subsequently the GVHD-related events may be attributed to other areas and possibly cell types. Thus any proliferation contributing to splenomegaly in the latter stages of GVHD appears to occur in the red pulp and that contributing to lymph node enlargement a medullary response."

The disease predominated in females (8.5:1), with age of onset usually less than 20 years. In half of the cases an acute inflammatory phase was observed, characterized mainly by systemic and cardiovascular symptoms. Subsequently the natural course of TA was toward chronicity with gradual  deterioration. The most frequent variety of TA (65 per cent of the patients) was Type III, in which the supra-aortic trunks and the abdominal aorta were involved. The predominant clinical features were reduction of amplitude of peripheral arterial pulses (96 per cent), vascular bruits (94 per cent), and raised blood pressure (72 per cent), mainly resulting from renal arterial involvement (62 per cent). Heart failure (28 per cent) is rarely the result of direct coronary arteritis. TA is most often confused with aortic coarctation, but usually the aortogram distinguishes these. The etiology of TA is discussed. The high incidence of previous and present active tuberculous (48 per cent) in the present series and previous experimental work suggest that tuberculosis may play an important role in the etiology of TA.

The presence of two endocrine tumors suggested the syndrome of multiple endocrine adenomatosis, and raised the issue of an etiologic relationship between this disease and the Maffucci syndrome. Dyschondroplasia, however, has no known influence on the secretion of parathyroid hormone or any of the pituitary hormones. The Maffucci syndrome is associated with a high incidence of malignancy, but it involves primarily mesodermal derivatives whereas multiple endocrine adenomatosis affects tissues of ectodermal origin. The association of the two in our patient is probably fortuitous."

The drug was withdrawn and the hyperlactatemia subsided in three days without specific treatment. In vitro, nitrofurantoin is capable of stimulating erythrocyte glucose utilization aand lactate production, and inhibiting the generation of reduced glutathione. In vivo, this drug is capable of producing hemolysis in susceptible subjects and hepatocellular injury. The temporal proximity of drug ingestion and hemolysis, increased glucose utilization, lactate excess, and hepatic insufficiency suggests that nitrofurantoin may have been responisble for precipitating the clinical and chemical abnormalities observed."

The epidemiology of Timor filariasis was observed during a clinical and parasitologic survey of persons living in a remote village on the island of Flores, Southeast Indonesia. Infection and disease was distributed evenly throughout the community, which was in accord with the breeding and feeding habits of the only identified vector, Anopheles barbirostris. Although micfofilaremia rates appeared independent of host variables of age and sexes and sex, symptoms of disease were greater among males than females, and in both sexes disease rates more than doubled between the first and second decades of life. Symptoms included recurring episodes of inguinal and femoral lymphadenitis with retrograde lymphangitis and fever, abscesses of lymph glands or vessels along the path of the great sapheneous vein and its mae highest yet reported for the Timor filaria; it is a virulent parasite causing serious ill-health among the inhabitants of eastern Flores."

In all cases pneumococcus was isolated in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Seventeen pneumococci were studied for their sensitivity to fosfomycin, ampicillin and gentamicin, including their MIC. All were sensitive to fosfomycin and ampicillin and 7 to gentamicin. On the other hand there has also been made a study of the interaction between fosfomycin plus ampicillin and fosfomycin plus gentamicin. The concentration of antibiotics in plasma and CSF had been determined. The association of fosfomycin to penicillin or ampicillin was also studied in some cases, depending on whether the patient was younger or older than 2 years, and in other cases, the association of fosfomycin with gentamicin. The concentrations of antibiotics in the CSF varied according to the stage of evolution of the meningitis. As regards clinical results, 10 cures and 2 failures have been obtained. The pneumococcus was eradicated from the CSF in all cases, including the two failures, in the control carried out 2-3 days after beginning of treatment, the rest of the analytical data of the CSF became normal within 5 and 17 days treatment."

Penetration of the GI tract with subsequent infection of the pelvic viscera seems to be the most likely mode of infection. Penicillin has an important role in the treatment of this disease. It does not cure, but retards the course of the infection. Surgical extirpation of infected tissue in combination with penicillin offers the best therapeutic results. When chronic pelvic inflammatory disease does not respond to therapy, when the sedimentation rate remains high, and the patient's general debility is progressive, an actinomycotic infection should be suspected."

Lecithin/sphingomyelin (L/S) ratio was measured and rapid surfactant test (RST) was performed on amniotic fluid samples drawn from 60 normal and 18 diabetic pregnancies, for determination of fetal lung maturity. The results were compared to the neonatal outcome. Comparison of L/S ratio and RST demonstrates a good correlation (95%) between the two tests in normal pregnancies. In diabetic pregnancies, however, correlation is notably lower (54%). Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) was predicted in both L/S ratio and RST in 35-40% of normal pregnancies, with 60-65% of false negative results. In diabetic pregnancies the L/S ratio was as reliable as in normal pregnancies, but the RST was less reliable, with an RDS prediction rate of 18%. The assumption is made that increased amniotic fluid volume in diabetic pregnancies, results in dilution of the surfactant giving more false negative results in RST than are seen with L/S ratio, as in the latter, by measuring the ratio between the two constituents of amniotic fluid, the dilution factor is abolished. In diabetic pregnancies, a positive RST is reliable, but with negative results, L/S ratio must be determined for correct assessment of fetal lung maturity."

These levels are comparable to the levels observed in human and calf thymus gland and cell lines with some T cell characteristics (Molt 4 and 8402). Negligible levels of this activity were observed in chronic myelogenous leukemia not in an acute blast phase of the disease, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, human B cells, mature T cells, and the mixed population of lymphocytes present in normal human blood. The detection of this enzyme in some patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia in acute blast phase of the disease suggests that the blast proliferation may involve primitive stem cells which have more lymphoid than myelogenous characteristics. This enzyme assay may be of use as a biological marker for following patients during treatment and in remission."

This has been shown by a number of case reports. In addition to shock, however, certain intoxications and all forms of left heart failure produce the radiological changes of pulmonary oedema. Transient hyperhydration of the lungs following infusion therapy causes signs of pulmonary oedema which disappear as soon as the fluid balance becomes normal. The radiographic findings of pulmonary oedema correlate well with the intensity and extent of the pathological changes. The radiologist is therefore in a position to evaluate the severity of the shock lung; this is a valuable addition to the clinical findings and the results of physiological tests and blood gas analysis. It has to be emphasised that the radiological changes appear at an early stage, in any case much sooner than the clinical features. Radiological findings may be present without abnormalities on oscultation or percussion. Radiographs of the lungs are therefore indicated in all patients who may be subject to shock lung, particularly if they suffer from undiagnosed hyperventilation."

    "abstract": "Purification and properties of a heat-stable glucocerebrosidase activating factor from control and Gaucher spleen. Gaucher's disease is a lysosomal storage disease caused by a deficiency in the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. A small, heat-stable glycoprotein first obtained from Gaucher spleen (Ho, M. W., and O'Brien, J. S. (1971) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.A. 68, 2810-2813) has been observed to stimulate the activity of glucocerebrosidase isolated from normal tissue. It has been suggested that this material might be important in the physiological catabolism of glucocerebroside in normal individuals (Ho, M. W. (1974) in Enzyme Therapy in Lysosomal Storage Diseases (Tager, J. M., Hooghwinkel, G. J. M., and Daems, W. Th., eds) pp.239-246, North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam). In order to investigate this suggestion, glucocerebrosidase activating factors were isolated and purified from control and Gaucher spleen and characterized. Although approximately the same mass of activator was isolated from both spleens, the two activators differ from one another in a number of important respects: (a) the activator from the control spleen is only 6 per cent as active (on a protein basis) as the activator from Gaucher spleen; (b) the amino acid compositions of the purified activators are significantly different; and (c) carbohydrate analysis of the purified activators indicates that the activator from Gaucher spleen is a glycoprotein, while that from control spleen is not. Comparative kinetic studies demonstrate that the anionic detergent, sodium taurocholate, and the acidic phospholipid, phosphatidylinositol, both stimulate glucocerebrosidase activity to a larger extent than the activator substance from Gaucher spleen. The activator from Gaucher spleen and human liver glucocerebrosidase both appear to contain significant hydrophobic character. We conclude that the activator is probably not physiologically important in the catabolism of glucocerebroside in normal tissues. The significance of the occurrence of this apparently unique glycoprotein activator in Gaucher spleen remains obscure; however, its presence represents another interesting aspect of Gaucher's disease that warrants further investigation."

The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that chlorpheniramine (CP), and H1 blocker, can cause bronchodilatation if administered intravenously (iv) and in higher doses than those currently prescribed. In 10 subjects with allergic asthma, forced expiratory flows (FEF) were recorded on different days, at comparable baseline values, before and up to 5 hr after administration of 8 mg per os (po) chlorpheniramine, 10 mg iv CP (repeated twice), 5.5 mg/kg iv aminophylline, and 30 mg po butabarbital as well as during a day without drug. Chlorpheniramine administered intravenously produced reproducible increases (+ delta) in FEF, starting at 15 min, peaking at 120 min, and still persisting at 5 hr; the peak + delta averaged 15% for FEV1 and 27% to 53% for flows at low lung volume. FEF showed a comparable + delta after aminophylline, a smaller + delta after orally administered chlorpheniramine and no significant + delta during butabarbital or control sessions. The ratio change over time/variability was higher for FEV1, FEF50%, and FEF25%-75% than for the remaining parameters. In six subjects a double-blind study (chlorpheniramine vs. saline solution) confirmed the effectiveness of the doses administered in the open study. In three subjects, 10 mg iv chlorpheniramine was given at four different baseline values; the highest + delta occurred when the basal FEV1 was approximately 50% of the predicted value and the basal FEF at low lung volume 30% to 40% of the predicted value. In two subjects, log dose-response curves to 2.5, 5.0, and 10.0 mg iv chlorpheniramine were obtained by using FEV1, FEF50%, and FEF25%-75%. Thus chlorpheniramine in high iv doses can dilate the bronchi, the + delta FEF depending on the dose, the percent of the predicted basal FEF value, and \"individual\" responsiveness. Withing the dose range used, bronchodilatation to chlorpheniramine and aminophylline administered intravenously was best detected by FEV1, FEF50%, and FEF25%-75%."

This activity is localized in the high speed supernatant fraction, indicating the presence of an active PGE2-9-ketoreductase associated with the cytoplasmic fraction of the skin. Transformation of PGE2 into PGF2alpha is enhanced by skin specimens from psoriatic plaques and EFA-deficient rats, both characterized by excessive cellular proliferation and increased NADPH production. Incubations of the 105,000 g supernatant fractions from normal and EFA-deficient rats demonstrated that the activity of the PGE2-9-ketoreductase was elevated in high speed preparations from EFA-deficient rats. Results from these studies suggest that the increased activity of PGE2-9-ketoreductase observed in skin from human psoriatic plaques and EFA-deficient rats may be due in part to the increased generation of NADPH by these tissues and in part to alteration of the PGE2-9-ketoreductase by the excessive proliferation of the tissues."

    "abstract": "Octopamine. Octopamine is highly concentrated in neurones of several invertebrate species. Unlike in mammals, octopaminergic neurones in invertebrates are spatially separated from catecholaminergic neurons. In identified nerve cells of Aplysia, however, this amine coexists with other putative neurotransmitters. Octopamine is synthesized in nerves from tyrosine and tyramine and metabolised mainly by monoamine oxidase. When lobster nerves are depolarized, octopamine is liberated by a Ca2+-dependent process. A specific adenylate cyclase is stimulated by octopamine in several invertebrates to activate phosphorylase in the cockroach, induce a light-flash in firefly lattern or inhibit rhythm contractions in locust muscle. All of these observations provide compelling evidence that octopamine is a neurotransmitter in invertebrates. In mammals octopamine is localised in nerves in peripheral tissues and brain where it seems to coexist with noradrenaline, the catecholamine being present in much higher concentrations. Octopamine is released from nerves together with noradrenaline and it may under certain conditions modify the actions of the adrenergic neurotransmitter. Octopamine is present in unusually high concentrations in certain neurological and hepatic diseases and may have a pathophysiological role."

In an attempt to determine the mechanism of action of L-proly-L-leucyl-glycine amide (MIF-I) in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, various parameters of dopaminergic neuronal function were studied in rats. It was found that the active uptake of 3H-dopamine (3H-DA) by synaptosome-rich homogenates of the striatum of rats treated with MIF-I (1 mg/kg IP X 3, 24 hr intervals) was unaltered 1 hr after final treatment with MIF-I. Also, neither tyrosine hydroxylase nor dopa decarboxylase activity was altered in the striatum and substantia nigra of rats treated with MIF-I (20 mg/kg IP X 3, 24 hr intervals). Thus, vital functional processes associated with dopaminergic neurons apparently are not altered by MIF-I under the conditions studied. These findings illustrate the importance of concurrent DOPA administration in observing an effect of MIF-I on dopaminergic neuronal function."

When given in equipotent beta1 blocking doses, the nonselective blocker propranolol and the beta1 selective blocker metoprolol differ markedly as regards inhibition of adrenaline induced beta2 mediated vasodilatation. Only propranolol will inhibit this effect. After propranolol, adrenaline therefore elicits a haemodynamic effect pattern characterized by high peripheral vascular resistance, high arterial blood pressure, low cardiac output and increased cardiac size.

No successful attempt has been made to control the tsetse vector in the Division. The incidence and geographical distribution of cases of T. gambiense sleeping sickness in the Gboko area are described in this report. Cases were treated with Antrypol Tryparsamide mixture and Mel B. The highest number of cases of infection is usually picked up just before the start of the rains in early April. It is suggested that, for meaningful control of the disease a quick method should be devised to rid the area of the insect vector."

Mention should be made of their predominance in the feminine sex (85 per cent) and their maximum frequency between the ages of 21-50 (average age 34). DS was the first adverse reaction to drugs in 71 per cent of the cases. Therefore DS unpredictability is very frequent. A retrospective study suggested the role of risk factors which should help the doctor to prevent DS (personal allergic antecedents, antecedents of adverse reactions to drugs, neuroses, disorders of endocrine glands, feminine sex, etc.). In 1970, the clinical concept of shock imminence (SI) was formulated and it is applied to various etiologies (drugs, insect stings, food). The existence of SI was identified in the case history of 14 per cent of the persons with DS. SI is a syndrome which includes all clinical manifestations with imminent potential of transformation into shock condition, and represents the stage precursory to the setting up of shock. The utility of SI diagnosis is maximum if it also includes the causal factor (e.g. SI by penicillin or aspirin). The clinical image of SI may vary from the monosymptomatic aspect (urticaria, vomiting, diarrhoea, headaches, etc.) to the one with complex symptomatology (mixed form). Usually the symptoms are dramatic and depend on the administration of a certain drug (often in SI of allergic origin) or of various drugs (mainly on non-immunologic form). The absence of vascular collapse differentiates SI from shock. Differential diagnosis is more difficult in border cases with a slight diminution of blood pressure. SI can be diagnosed especially in several circumstances: when the first adverse drug reaction is dramatic; when the first allergic-type reaction to a drug occurs; when the repetition of drug reactions is amplified in intensity or frequency; when it occurs in persons with risk factors. The differential diagnosis of SI is made with a crude or minimum shock and with pre-shock condition. The advantages of SI diagnosis are the institution of efficient treatment with rapid recoverability and the prevention of subsequent shock to the respective drug."

    "abstract": "Studies of glucose turnover and renal function in an unusual case of hereditary fructose intolerance. Examination of glucose kinetics, pancreatic alpha and beta cell function, plasma lipids, urinary acidification and calcium excretion has been undertaken in a patient with hereditary fructose intolerance. This case was unusual as it was associated with insulin-requiring diabetes, type IV hyperlipemia, hypercalciuria and renal calculi. He also demonstrated the previously described fructose-induced defect of urine acidification. Glucagon and C-peptide assays showed that the pancreatic alpha cells were stimulated by fructose and that the beta cells did not respond to fructose. It is not known whether the latter was due to his diabetes or to the lack of a beta cell response to this sugar. Primed 14C-glucose infusions were used for the first time to study nonsteady state glucose kinetics in man. They showed that, 24 hours after the last insulin injection and under basal conditions, the glucose concentrations increased because glucose production exceeded glucose utilization. However, after the administration of sorbitol the plasma glucose concentration decreased because glucose production decreased. After the administration of sorbitol there was no change in the metabolic clearance of glucose. This reflects the lack of a peripheral insulin effect and is consistent with the lack of any measurable C-peptide. Glucose utilization also decreased, but this decrease was less than the decrease in glucose production. Because the metabolic clearance of glucose remained unchanged, it was concluded that the change in glucose utilization was solely due to the decrease in glucose concentration. The absence of C-peptide in the plasma indicated that changes in glucose turnover were not related to any changes in endogenous plasma insulin. Furthermore, the plasma glucagon concentration increased and, hence, changes in this hormone could not account for the decrease in glucose production. Therefore, it was concluded that the sorbitol-induced decline in glucose production was due to a direct effect on hepatic metabolism."

Etiology of the process was determined on the basis of characteristic structural changes in the CNS and other organs, findings of virological and bacteriological investigations. In the majority of children the intravascular blood coagulation was observed. Waterhouse-Friderichsen's syndrome was revealed mainly in meningococcal infection. In order to ascertain the data obtained case records of 120 children, who had undergone treatment in connection with meningococcal infection, were analysed. It turned out that all 42 children, who had developed this disease independently, recovered. Combination of the disease with AVRI led to fatal outcomes in 12 cases out of 72."

Ganglioside GM2 and its asialo-derivative, GA2 were radiolabeled in their N-acetyl-D-galactosaminyl moieties by oxidation with galactose oxidase and reduction with tritiated sodium borohydride. Specific activities of 6 X 10(4) dpm/nmol (GM2) and 1.8 X 10(6) dpm/nmol (GA2) were achieved. About 98% of the label was in N-acetyl-D-galactosamine. Using these substrates, an assay was developed for GM2-N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosaminidase (E.C.3.2.1.30) and GA2-N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosaminidase (E.C.3.2.1.30) activities in human cultured skin fibroblasts. The products of the GM2 cleaving reaction were identified as N-acetylgalactosamine and ganglioside GM3. Both GM2 and GA2 cleaving activities were stimulated about 5-fold by purified sodium taurocholate, and this stimulation was inhibited by neutral detergents, lipids and albumin at low concentrations. Addition of various salts, reducing agents and a protein activator factor from human liver of Li et al. (1973) did not stimulate GM2-N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosaminidase activity beyond that found with sodium taurocholate. Under optimal conditions, control fibroblast supernates cleaved ganglioside GM2 at a rate of 3.7 nmol/mg protein/h compared to 1100 for GA2-N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosaminidase and 4700 for 4-methylumbelliferyl-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase. Supernates from two patients with Tay-Sachs disease had markedly reduced activity levels for GM2-N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosaminidase but not for the other two substrates. Supernates from two patients with Sandhoff's disease had reduced activities for all three substrates. A supernate from one patient with juvenile GM2 gangliosidosis cleaved GM2 at a somewhat faster rate than those from Tay-Sachs or Sandhoff's patients. Two healthy adult women with markedly reduced hexosaminidase A activities using 4MU-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminide as substrate had approximately half-normal activities using GM2 as substrate. A patient with the Tay-Sachs phenotype but with a partial deficiency of hexosaminidase A using the 4-MU substrate had a profound deficiency using GM2 as substrate. In such unusual hexosaminidase mutants, assays using GM2 as substrate are better indicators of phenotype than those using synthetic substrates."

Small doses that are safe under normal conditions may cause severe and even fatal side-effects. As a consequence, modification of the usual drug dosage of these drugs in required in renal insufficiency. Since the risk of retention concerns only those drugs which are mainly excreted by the kidney, it is possible to establish a mathematical relationship between glomerular filtration rate and the rate of drug elimination. These relationships serve as a basis for the determination of the proper dosage regimen for the individual patient. Such dosage adaptation for intermitten drug administration can be obtained by two methods and a series of compromises between them: (1) increase of the dosage interval without changing the dose, and (2) reduction of the does without changing the frequency of administration. One must however, not only consider inadequate drug elimination but also a number of other  factors. Some of these modify the behaviour of the drug, such as hypoalbumineamia, which causes an increase of the unbound portion of the drug; anomalies of the volume of distribution, as found in patients with oedema; metabolic disturbance; alteration of absorption from the gastro-intestinal tract, etc. Other factors are related only indirectly to the pharmacokinetic behaviour of the drug. Frequently, there is an increased sensitivity to the undesirable side-effects of certain drugs in patients with renal insufficiency, causing the level of tolerance to be lowered compared with normal patients. Such an effect probably involves functional or morphological modifications of the drug receptors, or interaction with substance retained in renal insufficiency. Furthermore, drugs may accentuate the consequences of the nephropathy or have increased nephrotoxicity for those with diseased kidneys. It is with these important reservations that a critical analysis of the proposed methods of adapting drug dosage in renal insufficiency is presented. An appendix tabulates the effects of renal insufficiency on the behaviour of 117 drugs. Irrespective of the method used to calculate drug dosage, all patients with renal disease must be monitored closely, particularly for signs of unexpected drug toxicity."

Theophylline, which acts to increase cyclic AMP by inhibition of phosphodiesterase and beta 2 adrenergic agents which increase cyclic AMP by stimulating adenylate cyclase, are the mainstays of asthma therapy. Therapy is usually begun with theophylline. Persistent symptoms with adequate theophylline levels (10-20 mug/ml) indicates the need for a beta 2 adrenergic agent by aerosol or orally as a supplement.

An increase in chromosome breaks and rearrangements is also present in NZB mice developing spontaneously an autoimmune disorder that has been extensively studied by workers interested in lupus erythematosus.

In order to maintain double blindness, sorbitol syrup was used as a control solution along with neomycin and was compared with lactulose syrup and placebo tablets in a double drug protocol. Twenty-nine patients were studied in a crossover investigation in which each received both therapeutic regimens preceded and followed by control periods. Four additional patients received one or the other agent, but did not receive both. Serial, semiquantitative assessments were made in all patients of mental status, asterixis, and the trailmaking test (TMT) and electroencephalograms (EEG) and arterial ammonia levels. Both neomycin-sorbitol and lactulose were effective in the majority of patients (83 and 90%, respectively). Each of these parameters (mental state, asterixis, TMT, EEG, and NH3) was improved significantly by neomycin-sorbitol and lactulose. The post-treatment levels for each of these measures were similar in the neomycin and lactulose-treated groups. Mean stool pH was reduced by neomycinsorbitol to 6.1 and by lactulose to 5.5. This difference was highly significant statistically. Bowel activity was similar in the two groups. Both drugs were free of toxicity. These investigations demonstrate that both lactulose and neomycin-sorbitol are effective in the treatment of chronic portal-systemic encephalopathy."

Lower esophageal sphincter pressure, basal gastric pH, fasting plasma gastrin, and plasma concentrations of estrone, estradiol, and progesterone were measured in pregnant volunteers at 12, 24, and 36 weeks of gestation, and again at 1 to 4 weeks postpartum. In addition, basal and pentagastrin-stimulated acid secretory responses at each time were measured. No differences in basal gastric pH, basal, and peak acid outputs were observed during pregnancy when compared to the postpartum values. In contrast, lower esophageal sphincter pressure was reduced at all times during pregnancy, reaching a nadir at 36 weeks. Postpartum lower esophageal pressures were normal. As expected, plasma concentrations of progesterone and both estrogens increased progressively during pregnancy. These data are consistent with earlier studies in women ingesting oral contraceptives. Moreover, they provide support for the thesis that the progressive increase in plasma progesterone alone or in combination with estrogens that occurs during pregnancy is responsible for the reduction of lower esophageal sphincter pressure which allows esophageal reflux to occur with the resultant development of symptomatic heartburn."

Mean frequencies of apneic spells were 13.6 +/- 2.5 and 2.1 +/- 0.6 apnea per day before and after initiation of caffeine treatment, respectively.

    "abstract": "[Gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase in chronic polyarthritis. I. Comparison with a control group and relationship with alkaline phosphatase]. Gamma-GT, alcaline phosphatase and other parameters of abnormal liver functions were estimated in 54 consecutive in-patients having active RA but without a previous history or clinical signs of liver disease, and compared with a matched control group, suffering from degenerative rheumatic disease. There was a slight to moderate elevation of gamma-GT in 40.4% of the RA-patients (mean value 27.2 IU/l) and in 32.1% (mean value 22.3 IU/l) of the control group, respectively. The difference was not significant. Abnormal values in the control group occurred mainly in patients with peri-arthropathia of the shoulder, before mobilisation under anaethetic (3 of 5) and - coxarthrosis before total hip replacement (4 of 12). Alkaline phosphatase was elevated in 25.9% of the RA-patients (mean value 41.3 +/- 21.9 IU/l) and in 14.8% of the control group (mean value 34.3 +/- 15.9 IU/l). The difference was significant. There was a correlation between gamma-GT and alcaline phosphatase in the RA-group (r = 0.549, p less than 0.001) but not in the control group (r = 0.102). Abnormal values found in the control group were mainly found among patients with osteoporosis, following fractures, and coxarthrosis. The frequency of abnormal results and the value of the means increased with raising disease activity. Two groups of 30 and 32 patients, respectively, were examined at intervals of 2 or 4 weeks over a period of 6-10 and 18 months, respectively, and showed temporary elevations os gamma-GT in 3/4 of all patients, of GOT in 2/3 of alcaline phosphatase in 1/2 and of GPT in 1/3. Compared with other parameters of liver disease gamma-GT did not react in a different but in a more sensitive way. In our opinion it is the most sensitive indicator of reactive changes of the liver in RA."

    "abstract": "Infantile periarteritis nodosa or mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome. A report on four cases and diagnostic considerations. Coronary artery aneurysm in childhood is a rare disease and has in most cases been ascribed to infantile periarteritis nodosa (IPN). In recent years a mucocutaneous lymph node syndrom (MLNS) has been found almost exclusively in Japan first described by Kawasaki 1967; this disease frequently involves the coronary arteries and myocardium. Four cases with coronary aneurysms are presented from Sweden and seem to be first described from Scandinavia. Three of these patients died a sudden death with cardiac arrest. Since MLNS and IPN have identical clinical and pathological features, we suggest that MLNS and IPN constitute a pathologic entity and that to separate them on a clinical or histological basis is nonsensical. The risk of coronary aneurysm and possible sudden death must be considered in patients with uncharacteristic symptoms including prolonged fever, conjunctivitis, exanthema, lesions in the oral mucosa, elevated sedimintation rate, and leukocytosis."

Postoperative coronary bypass flow was evaluated in two groups of randomly selected patients with grafts to the left anterior descending artery (LAD). Saphenous vein bypass grafts were placed in 27 patients and internal mammary artery grafts in 25 patients. Postoperative flow studies were performed in both groups with roentgendensitometric methods based on the transit time of radiopaque media along the graft plus the mean graft diameter. There was no significant difference between the two groups of patients for age, duration of symptoms, or the frequency of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, prior myocardial infarction, or cardiomegaly. Intraoperative bypass flows were 75+/-27 and 77+/-24 ml. per minute for the saphenous vein group (SVG) and internal mammary artery group (IMAG), respectively. There was no significant difference in the heart rate or mean aortic pressure at the time of the roentgendensitometric flow study. The mean graft diameters were 3.0+/-0.5 and 1.9+/-0.3 mm. for the SVG and IMAG, respectively (p less than 0.001). The ratios of graft diameter to LAD diameter were 1.9+/-0.3 and 1.2+/-0.2 for the SVG and IMAG, respectively (p less than 0.001). The roentgendensitometric postoperative flows were 68+/-27 ml. per minute in the SVG and 46+/-16 ml. per minute in the IMAG (p less than 0.01). The present study indicates that flow in significantly higher in saphenous vein than in internal mammary artery bypasses and that the difference in flow may in part be explained on the basis of the graft diameter."

We infused an aspirin-buffer solution intravenously at rates up to 1,200 mg of aspirin per hour and compared effects on lung lymph flow and lymph protein concentration to those seen after mechanical elevation of pulmonary vascular pressures. Aspirin had little effect on lung vascular pressures but caused lung lymph flow to increase an average of greater than twice baseline. Because lymph protein concentrations were higher for a given lymph flow with aspirin than during mechanical pressure elevation, lymph protein (lymph flow X lymph to plasma protein concentration) increased much more with aspirin. Thus, aspirin appears to cause increased permeability to fluid and protein in the pulmonary vascular bed. Aspirin caused arterial PO2 to decrease from 83 +/- 3 SE mm Hg to 74 +/- 3 mm Hg (P less than 0.05) and caused postmortem extravascular lung water to increase.

One hundred patients, 54 with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and 46 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), considered to be in the end stages of their disease, after combination chemotherapy were treated by marrow transplantation. All patients were given a marrow graft from an HLA-identical sibling after receiving 1000-rad total body irradiation (TBI). One group of 43 patients was given cyclophosphamide (CY), 60 mg/kg on each of 2 days, 5 and 4 days before TBI. In a second group of 31 patients, additional chemotherapy was given before CY and TBI. In a third group of 19 patients, BCNU was given before CY and TBI. A fourth group of 7 patients received other chemotherapy regimens before TBI. Six patients died 3-17 days after marrow infusion without evidence of engraftment. Ninety-four patients were engrafted and only one patient rejected the graft. Thirteen patients are alive with a marrow graft, on no maintenance antileukemic therapy, and without recurrent leukemia 1-4 1/2 yr after transplantation. Three have chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Four patients are alive 1 1/2 - 3 1/2 yr after grafting but have had a relapse of their leukemia. Of 93 evaluable patients, 19 did not develop GVHD and 24 developed very mild GVHD. Fifty patients developed moderate to severe GVHD, and 40 of these were treated with antithymocyte globulin. Interstitial pneumonia occurred in 54 patients and was the primary cause of death in 34. Interstitial pneumonia often occurred in association with GVHD and the most common etiologic agent was cytomegalovirus. A total of 31 patients have had a relapse of leukemia. There was no definite correlation between relapse of leukemia and the presence or absence of GVHD. The relapse rate appeared to be relatively constant over the first 2 yr and was extremely low after that time. Neither survival nor leukemic relapse appeared to be influenced by the type of leukemia nor by the preparative chemotherapy regimen given before TBI. Patients in fair clinical condition at the time of transplantation showed significantly longer survival times than patients in poor condition (p = 0.001). This observation, coupled with the observation that some patients may be cured of their disease, indicates that marrow transplantation should now be undertaken earlier in the management of patients with acute leukemia who have an HLA-matched sibling marrow donor."

N-[4-(5-Nitro-2-furyl)-2-thiazolyl]acetamide (NFTA) administered at 1000 ppm in diet to mice for 12 weeks induced a high incidence of lymphocytic leukemia. Effects of NFTA on antibody-mediated immunity and cell-mediated immunity of BALB/c mice were studied using the spleen plaque assay for detection of immunoglobulin M-producing cells and the graft-versus-host (GVH) reaction, respectively. NFTA suppressed both responses. With the spleen plaque assay, the number of antibody-forming cells (AFC) to sheep red blood cells was significantly less than in unmedicated, control mice after treated mice received NFTA at 1000 ppm for 6 days. The GVH reaction was not suppressed at 21 days, but was severely suppressed at 70 days, prior to the histological appearance of leukemia. Effect of dose was studied by administering NFTA at 100, 250, 500, and 1000 ppm of diet for 13 to 14 weeks and then determining the response in the spleen plaque assay and GVH reactions. The ratio of AFC/spleen of NFTA-treated groups to AFC/spleen of an unmedicated control group, at the above specified doses, was 0.86, 0.22, 0.33, and 0.54 in ascending dosage order beginning with 100 ppm. For the GVH reaction, the suppression of the cell-mediated immunity was directly proportional to the dose of NFTA. Suppression of the antibody-mediated immunity in relation to the induction of leukemia at 28 weeks was studied by feeding NFTA at 500 ppm for 14 weeks, followed by unmedicated diet for 14 weeks. During the 11th week, mice were immunized with SRBC; 5 days later the spleens were removed and the spleen plaque assay was performed. Eight of 18 mice fed NFTA developed leukemia. The number of AFC/spleen was 78 X 10(3) +/- 34 for those with leukemia and 68 X 10(3) +/- 24 (p greater than 0.5) for those without leukemia, compared with 170 X 10(3) +/- 74 for the control mice (p less than 0.01 for both groups, compared with controls). A closely related carcinogenic nitrofuran, N-[4-(5-nitro-2-furyl)-2-thiazolyl]formamide, did not suppress the antibody-mediated immunity response measured during the 11th week of administration."

Fainting is a common symptom and has been attributed to ypersensitivity of the baroreflex. We studied baroreflex sensitivity in 11 patients with Takayasu's aortitis and compared it with that of eight control subjects of comparable age. Baroreflex sensitivity was assessed by determining the slope of a regression line relating the rise of systolic arterial pressure to the prolongation of the R-R interval of the electrocardiogram during a transient rise of arterial pressure induced by an intravenous injection of phenylephrine. The average baroreflex slope of patients with Takayasu's arteritis (4.0 +/- 0.8 msec/mm Hg) was significantly less than that of control subjects (10.7 +/- 0.8 msec/mm Hg, P less than 0.001). Reduced baroreflex sensitivity in patients with Takayasu's aortitis may be due to the hardening of the arteries where baroreceptors lie, or to hypertension and/or cardiac disease which was present in most of the patients included in this study. Patients with Takayasu's aortitis who complained of fainting also showed the reduced baroreflex sensitivity. This indicates that fainting in this disease is not likely to be caused by the hyperreactivity of the baroreceptors as is commonly postulated."

Subcellular fractionation experiments demonstrate that the lysosomes, which have strikingly reduced equilibrium densities, accumulate melanin. Morphological studies confirm the presence of pigments within lysosomes. 3. Although there are increased activities of lysosomal acid hydrolases in the liver tissue from patients with the DJS syndrome, the integrity of these organelles is essentially normal and therefore the accumulation of pigment would not be expected to initiate liver damage. The DJS syndrome is thus a benign type of secondary lysosomal storage disease."

Guanylate cyclase is found in virtually all cells, but its physiologic role and the effect of hormones on its activity have not been clarified. Hepatic soluble guanylate cyclase activity (37,000 g supernatant) in rats with diabetes-mellitus-like syndrome induced by streptozotocin, 65 mg./kg. i.v., was 140 +/- 8 pmoles accumulated/mg. protein/10 min. (n = 13 rats) as against 279 +/- 16 pmoles accumulated/mg. protein/10 min. (n = 12 rats) in normal rats. The average blood sugar for the 12 normal rats was 100 +/- 4 mg./100 ml. and 546 +/- 32 mg./100 ml. for 13 diabetic rats. The decreased soluble hepatic guanylate cyclase activity in diabetic rats was completely restored to normal with 10 U. regular insulin, i.p. The maximum increase in guanylate cyclase activity was observed as early as five minutes and as late as two hours after insulin administration. Insulin restoration of guanylate cyclase was dose-related over a range of 1 U. to 10 U., i.p. Hepatic cyclic GMP levels in vivo paralleled in-vitro guanylate cyclase activity, being 29 +/- 0.4 pmoles/gm. wet weight in normals, 17 +/- 0.4 pmoles/gm. wet weight in streptozotocin-diabetic rats, and 38 +/- 0.4 pmoles/gm. wet weight two hours after the injection of 10 U. regular insulin. We conclude that rat hepatic guanylate cyclase is decreased in streptozotocin-induced diabetes and that insulin modulates this enzyme. The administration of exogenous insulin in normal animals did not further augment hepatic guanylate cyclase activity."

The levansucrase hydrolyzes sucrose to produce free glucose and levan; some free fructose is also formed. There is no requirement for cofactors. The Km for sucrose is 12 mM. A variety of heavy metal ions and two disaccharides, lactose and cellobiose, inhibit the enzyme. The levansucrase was purified to homogeneity and has a specific activity of 90 micronmol of glucose release per min per mg. The enzyme has a molecular weight of 220,000 and is composed of subunits of molecular weight 80,000. The levan product contains both beta(2 leads to 1) and beta(2 leads to 6) linkages. The enzyme remains tightly bound to the levan product, resulting in the formation of high-molecular-weight polymer on the order of 10(8) daltons.

Prognostic factors associated with graft versus host disease and survival. 73 consecutive patients with severe aplastic anemia were treated by marrow transplantation from hematologically normal HLA identical siblings. 68 patients lived long enough to document marrow engraftment. 21 rejected the graft and 19 of these died. 47 sustained engraftment and 18 of these died. In 16 patients, death was associated with graft versus host disease. 29 patients with sustained engraftment are alive with complete hematologic restoration between 8 mo and 5 yr. This analysis, by using a proportional hazards regression model, was directed at identifying factors that predicted survival (and absence of graft versus host disease). Of the 24 factors entered into the analysis only two strongly correlated with survival: (a) sex match of donor and recipient (P less than 0.01), and (b) absence of refractoriness to random donor platelets at the time of transplantation (P less than 0.05). Refractoriness adversely influenced the survival of the sex mismatched patients, These data suggest that X and Y-associated transplantation antigen systems are important determinants of the outcome of marrow grafts between HLA identical siblings for the treatment of aplastic anemia. The machanism by which refractoriness to random donor platelets influences survival is currently unclear."

Fifty patients with well-defined, poorly controlled ragweed allergy were studied during the 1974 ragweed season. Analysis of the data showed that the active drug group had a significant decrease in individual symptoms of sneezing, nasal stuffiness, and nasal secretions, compared with the placebo group. Antihistamine usage was statistically decreased in the active drug over placebo group. There was no evidence of adrenal suppression.

Myxofibrosarcoma is believed to belong to the general category of fibroblastic and histiocytic malignant soft tissue tumours. The median diameter of the tumours was 7 cm. They were divided into 4 grades according to cellularity, cell atypia and mitotic activity. The grade III and IV tumours showed pronounced atypia, often with the bi- and multinucleated giant tumour cells and occasionally with giant cells of Touton's type, suggesting a relationship to malignant fibroxanthoma. All of the patients were treated surgically and one received also pre- and post-operative irradiation. None of the 2 grade I myxofibrosarcomas recurred, while 2 out of 7 grade II tumours, 6 out of 10 grade III tumours, and 7 out of 11 grade IV tumours recurred once and up to 9 times. Metastasis appeared in 7 out of 30 patients; grade I tumours were not seen in any of these cases. By the time of follow-up after intervals ranging from 1 month up to 27 years, 14 patients had died; 6 of these had died post-operatively or of intercurrent disease. The differential diagnosis between myxofibrosarcoma and other myxoid soft tissue tumours is discussed."

Very low levels of arylsulfatase A (ASA) have been found in the leukocytes of healthy members of a metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) family. The cerebroside sulfate sulfatase (CSS) activities in the same individuals are about 10% of the control level. Arguments favoring a dominant mutation different from that of classical MLD are presented. This report reinforces the relationship between the two enzymatic activities."

Later, the ability of the tissues to extract glucose became impaired, and the plasma glucose concentration increased even more in spite of the return of Ra of glucose to the control level. The Ra of lactate rose rapidly postburn, whereas the rate of disappearance (Rd) of lactate stayed at the control level for 30 min. Consequently, plasma lactate rose approximately 350%. After 30 min, Rd of lactate increased to the same level as Ra; and Ra, Rd, plasma lactate concentration, and the percent of glucose derived from lactate remained elevated for the duration of the experiment.

Membrane-bound (particulate) and soluble amino acid 2-naphthylamidases (EC 3.5.1.-) were present in subcellular fractions of epidermis from pig and human. 2. The particulate enzymes exhibited Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with Km 5.1x10(-5) (pig) and Km 7.3x10(-5)M (human) for the substrate L-leucine 2-naphthylamide. They were inhibited by puromycin and partially inhibited by EDTA. They did not require heavy metals and were not inhibited by thiol-group-blocking agents. Their pH optima were 7.0 (human) and 6.6 (pig). The particulate enzyme from pig epidermis retained 50% activity after 30 min at 70 degrees C. 3. The soluble amino acid 2-naphthylamidases gave sigmoidal curves for reaction velocity versus substrate concentration, and the kinetic data suggested that there was positive co-operativity between binding sites. This co-operativity was lost after treatment with 0.1mM-p-hydroxymercuribenzoate and the enzymes showed first-order kinetics at low substrate concentrations. The soluble enzymes were inhibited by puromycin and by thiol-group-blocking agents and activated by dithiothreitol. They were inactivated above 60 degrees C and lost activity on storage, but this could be restored with dithiothreitol. 4. The amino acid 2-naphthylamidases of human epidermis were much more active (2.5 times) towards L-alanine 2-naphthylamide than towards the commonly used substrate L-leucine 2-naphthylamide. 5. The kinetics of both the solube and particulate enzymes from epidermis of some elderly patients with either diabetes or ischaemia showed some differences from the kinetics of enzymes from healthy epidermis from younger individuals."

An increase of both active and inactive forms of the fetal enzyme with gestational age.

Sulphasalazine is clearly useful in long-term management of ulcerative colitis and may be useful in Crohn's disease. The absorption, metabolism and excretion of sulphasalazine is similar in volunteers and patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. Sulphasalazine serves as a vehicle to deliver its possible active components, 5-aminosalicylic acid and sulphapyridine, to the colon in higher concentrations than could be achieved by oral administration of either one alone. Sulphasalazine reaches the colon mostly unchanged and is split by gut bacteria at the azo linkage, releasing 5-aminosalicylic acid and sulphapyridine. 5-Aminosalicylic acid may act locally and is not absorbed to any great extent. On the contrary, sulphapyridine is mostly absorpbed from the colon and may act both locally, during mucosal absorption, and systemically. A positive correlation exists between serum total sulphapyridine concentration and both therapeutic efficacy and toxicity. Sulphapyridine metabolism is largely determined by inherited acetylator phenotype, either slow or fast. Slow acetylators have higher levels of free sulphapyridine and lower levels of acetylated sulphapyridine than fast acetylators, and are likely to have more toxic symptoms on equivalent doses of sulphasalazine. Therapeutic effects of sulphasalazine in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease correlate with serum concentrations of total sulphapyridine (20 to 50 microng/ml), and toxicity with total sulphapyridine concentration greater than 50 microng/ml. Side-effects are mostly observed among slow acetylators. In long-term therapy of ulcerative colitis doses of 2 to 3g/day of sulphasalazine are most likely to sustain remissions and avoid toxicity. During therapy with sulphasalazine, determination of acetylator phenotype and total sulphapyridine concentration can guide effective dosage and avoid side-effects. A single serum sample for free and acetylated sulphapyridine concentrations is sufficient for this purpose."

Fifty-six (37%) of these subjects exhibited neuropsychological deficit. This deficit was partially related to increasing age, poor education and premorbid medical risk factors. The deficit was also associated with extensive and intensive use of two classes of drugs: sedatives (sleeping pills and minor tranquilizers) and opiates (heroin and other narcotic drugs). Seventeen (26%) of a comparison group of 66 psychiatric in-patients and day patients also demonstrated age- and education-correlated neuropsychological deficit. For these patients impairment was also related to lifetime experience with antipsychotic drugs and (perhaps) with clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia. Although both polydrug users and psychiatric patients revealed serious psychopathology as measured by the MMPI, the pattern of the neuropsychological test findings suggested that psychopathology alone did not account for impairment. The 3 month follow-up which is in progress should delineate further the time course and enduring features of neuropsychological deficit among polydrug users, and may establish more clearly the relationship of sedative and opiate use to such impairment. Changes in psychopathological status of both polydrug users and psychiatric patients should also help to clarify the influence of this variable on neuropsychological findings."

Tyramine oxidase level was elevated in livers with nonalcoholic fatty change or toxic hepatitis, and reduced in livers with fibrosis or chronic alcoholic injury. UDP-glucuronyl transferase activity was reduced in livers with severe parenchymal damage or hyperbilirubinemia. Acetyl CoA carboxylase activity decreased markedly in an active alcoholic cirrhotic liver, and was elevated in alcoholic fatty livers as well as in a liver with acute venous stasis."

A study is reported of the brain glycoproteins and the glycosaminoglycans in a case of infantile metachromatic leucodystrophy, associated with a ponto-cerebellar systemic atrophy, verified by autopsy. The glycosaminoglycan concentrations in the grey matter were within the normal range, while in the white matter they were slightly increased. The glycopeptides from the soluble and insoluble glycoproteins of white matter were altered not only in their quantity but also in their composition. In the grey matter a decrease of all sugars except the NaNa was detected in the insoluble fraction while in the soluble no change was detected, except for a threefold increase of fucose. The relationship was discussed of soluble to insoluble glycoproteins, and a mechanism for their derangement in MLD was suggested."

Unlike dimedrol and diprazine (promethazine) it has no inhibitory effect on the central nervous system. With its clinical use phencarol is effective in treating urticaria, Quincke's edema and allergic skin reactions. The drug is well tolerated by the patients and does not produce any inhibitory or soporific action. Phencarol has an authorized permission to be used for medical purposes."

    "abstract": "Late persistence of serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity after mononucleosis. Report of 3 cases. gamma-Glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP) is a sensitive but nonspecific index hepatobiliary disease. In infectious mononucleosis (IM) or the mononucleosis-like disease attributable to cytomegalovirus (cytomegalovirus-induced IM), GGTP reverted to normal later than aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase. In three cases elevated serum GGTP activity persisted for up to 24 months -- raising the question of persistent 'post-IM' hepatitis. Such prolonged GGTP activity was unusual in other late IM specimens. Possible, but unlikely, causes for such persistent GGTP activity are an unusual degree of hepatic damage during acute IM, excessive induction of microsomal enzyme system activity by drugs, or unusual Epstein-Barr virus carrier state activation that might contribute to ongoing hepatic structural damage. Other markers of chronic hepatocellular disease including aspartate aminotrasferase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin were normal in late specimens from these 3 patients. The cause of their persistent elevated GGTP activities remains unknown."

The therapy of Crohn's disease in adolescence must balance the natural disease history of growth suppression, debilitation, and progression against possible drug-related adverse effects on growth and development. In contrast to published guidelines which usually suggest episodic and symptomatic treatment of relapses, we have attempted to suppress disease activity throughout adolescence. Sixteen consecutive adolescent patients treated with continuous medical therapy for a mean duration of 3.5 years are presented. Fourteen received long term prednisone therapy for maintenance of disease suppression. All 16 have been asymptomatic or have had only mild symptoms which did not interfere with regular activities. Only 1 subject had to be rehospitalized. He subsequently underwent bowel surgery. Aternate day corticosteroid administration has been attained in 11 patients; 10 are growing and developing at a normal rate. In total, 13 of 16 have achieved pubertal development appropriate for age. The 8 patients with distal ileal disease have had a consistently excellent response to medical therapy. There have been no major adverse effects from drug therapy.

A comparable level of hyperuricemia (19.4+/-2.2 mg/100 ml) was achieved in all animals with intravenous urate infusion. Clearance and micropuncture studies were performed before and 1 h after induction of hyperuicemia. Group I rats had mean falls in renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate of 83 and 86%, respectively; nephron filtration rate decreased 66%, and tubular and microvascular pressures increased twofold. In Group II there were 45 and 47% declines in renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate, respectively, a 66% fall in nephron filtration rate, and a 30% increase in tubular and vascular pressures. Moderate amounts of urate were seen in the kidneys. Group III had changes in renal function identical to Group II suggesting that the moderate prehyperuricemic diuresis in the latter group and not urine alkalinization produced the partial protection observed. Groups IV and V were completely and comparably protected with renal function studies unchanged from controls.

    "abstract": "Studies on cellular inhibition and serum-blocking factors in 28 human patients given marrow grafts from HLA identical siblings. Fifteen patients with aplastic anemia and 13 with acute leukemia were studied 36 to 1547 days after treatment with high-dose cyclophosphamide and/or total-body irradiation and marrow transplantation from HLA identical siblings. Peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients and normals (marrow donors and healthy unrelated individuals) were tested for cell inhibition (CI) of cultured skin fibroblasts from both patients and donors by using the microcytotoxicity assay. In addition, blocking of CI by factors in patient serum was studied. Three groups of patients were studied. Patients in group I were stable long-term survivors without evidence of graft-vs-host diseases (GVHD) between 250 to 1547 days postgrafting. Patients in group II were short-term survivors with or without acute GVHD between 36 and 144 days postgrafting. Patients in group III had chronic GVHD either at the time of testing or developed chronic GVHD subsequent to CI testing between days 61 and 960 postgrafting. Eleven of 14 patients in group I showed absence of both CI and serum blocking and three showed CI and blocking. Patients in group II without acute GVHD showed absence of CI and serum blocking on three occasions, presence of CI and blocking on four occasions, and CI without blocking on three occasions. Patients in group II with acute GVHD showed absence of CI on one occasion and presence of CI and blocking on three occasions. Patients in group III showed absence of CI and blocking on seven occasions and CI without blocking on two occasions. These results suggest that the maintenance of stable graft-host tolerance in long-term survivors after marrow grafting from HLA identical donors does not depend on the presence of serum-blocking factors. Short-term survivors with and without GVHD showed a spectrum of in vitro reactivity with 50% of the patients showing serum-blocking factors, and these results did not appear to be correlated with presence or absence of acute GVHD. Finally, results of the microcytotoxicity assays failed to provide insight into the mechanism of chronic GVHD."

Four cases of overwhelming bacteremia were observed in asplenic renal transplant patients 12 to 20 months after transplantation. The bacteriologic findings and presentation of these infections are characteristic of post-splenectomy sepsis reported in nontransplant patients. It is suggested that the absence of the spleen, more than immunosuppression with azathioprine and prednisone, predisposes to these late, uncommon infections after transplantation."

On the first day the exercise was not preceded by any medication; on the second, 50 mg thiazinamium was given, and on the third day 2 mg atropine was given before the exercise. The changes in the calibre of the bronchi were assessed with a Wright peak flow meter. With thiazinamium a complete protection against the bronchoconstriction was observed in 12 patients, in one the protection was partial and in an other no beneficial effect of the drug was found. It seems that protection given by thiazinamium was due to its antihistaminic property and not to the anticholinergic one, as among 10 patients protected by thiazinamium, only 2 were also protected by the atropine."

    "abstract": "[New aspects in diagnosis and therapy of placental insufficiency. Placental perfusion measurements; placental perfusion test (PPT) and betamimetic long term treatment (clinical and experimental data (authors transl)]. The rate of utero-placental blood flow depends on functional components (perfusion pressure and flow resistance within the area of the vascular bed of the placenta), as well as on morphological factors (regressive changes in the placenta). Different primary maternal conditions and diseases may lower the rate of placental flow, leading to placental insufficiency; the highest percentage, by far, of placental dysfunction is found in patients suffering from gestosis. Hypocirculation initially present in cases of EPH gestosis and caused by arteriolar spasms triggers off a vicious circle involving placental infarction and severe reduction in the utero-placental perfusion rate. This in turn leads to fetal hypotrophy, a high rate of premature births and perinatal mortality. Verification of HPL, HCG, alpha-Fetoprotein or E3 in maternal serum and amniotic fluid or urine greatly improved the recording of partial placental functions. Along with ultrasonic biometry, cardiotocography and amnioscopy, these hormonal parameters allow only indirect assessment of the placental function. On the other hand, measurements of the utero-placental flow offers a direct approach. In order to evaluate the placental flow measurements it is imperative to obtain a curve indicating the course over the last third of the pregnancy-in addition to establishing a general normal range. In case of placental insufficiency, it is necessary to determine whether this is due to functional disorders alone, or to more extenisve morphological changes. A placental perfusion test (PPT) was developed in order to make this distinction. Beta2-mimetic treatment is indicated if functional factors predominate, whereby it appears essential to obtain the requisite experimental data for precise quantification of beta-mimetic action."

    "abstract": "[Measurement of transport in mucous membrane in the human nose with Cr-51-labeled resin beads]. The mucociliary transport of the human nasal mucosa was studied by using very small resin beads tagged with 51Cr. Several modifications of previous methods were introduced, e.g. kind of nuclide, particle size, pH, mode of application, measuring technique and reduction of local irradiation. Finally arrangements implying exact measurements of transport not only horizontally but also vertically or obliquely were obtained. No mucociliary transport was demonstrated in five of nine subjects with a common cold 10 days before or one week after the investigation. Xylometazolin as a nasal spray diminished the mucociliary transport significantly. In addition, the effects on mucociliary transport caused by homolateral or contralateral experimental nasal obstruction as well as by tobacco smoking were studied in healthy subjects. Finally, patients with various diseases: pollen allergy in free intervals, chronic rhinitis, septal deviation or perforation, and condition after laryngectomy were also investigated."

Several reflexes have the ability to produce apnea, in addition to the relatively common sleep apnea; the crucial aspect, rather, appears to be thefailure of the immature infant to resume respiration. The possibility exists that the infant, who did not have to breather for 9 months of fetal life, literally is not alarmed and aroused by the persistance of apnea. In human and animal studies, respiratory infections and sleep deprivation have been proved to increase the likelihood and duration of sleep apnea. If primary apnea continues for long (45 seconds or more), a dangerous positive feedback develops into hypoxic apnea. Hhis will persist until circulatory failure occurs, or until gasping occurs. The gasp is a highly effective mechanism at birth, but will occur too late for autoresuscitation after the anerobic capacity of fetal life dimineshes; we believe this capacity lasts for approximately 1 month, accounting for the hiatus of crib death, sparing the first month. The \"near-miss\" infant, after resuscitation, should be monitored at home, if practical, until 6 months of age.

The distal coronary arteries usually do not manifest arteritis and are normal in caliber. Angina pectoris may be the first symptom of the disease if the coronary arteries are the initial site of severe arterial narrowing.

A subpopulation of peripheral blood lymphocytes with the ability to lyse target cells coated with specific antibody (antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, ADCC) was serially studied in a patient with hepatitis B antigen-associated periarteritis nodosa. The effector lymphocytes possess FC and complement receptors but do not require complement for functional activity. We found that the patient's ADCC was decreased during periods of disease activity and was almost normal during remission. The patient's serum could block ADCC in normal lymphocytes, and the blocking ability correlated with the concentration of immune complexes as determined by the Raji cell assay (a radioimmunoassay using complement receptors on human cultured lymphoblastoid cells). The concentration of immune complexes and the ADCC blocking ability of ther serum both correlated with disease activity. Serum from five other patients with active vasculitis was found to contain significant amounts of immune complexes and was able to block normal ADCC.

The authors analyse the clinical and radiological repercussions of perfusion on the lung, in 40 patients operated under ECC for coronary revascularisation. The simutaneous study of the arterial, and mixed venous blood gasses and of the alveolar gases, in 20 of these patients showed the constant occurrence of a shunt syndrome, without alveolar hypoventilation or disorders in peripheral circulatory flow. Ventilatory alcalosis, hypocapnia, hypoxemia and the rise in the alveolar arterial oxygen gradient is increased during the second post-operative day. Among the variables studied (duration of ECC, degree of hypothermia, duration of the intervention, duration of anesthesia, pleurotomy) only the latter intervened in a statistically significant manner in this study, in the increase in hypoxemia. 46 pulmonary biopsies carried out before and after ECC in 23 coronary patients were examined with the electron microscope. The initial alveolar involvement affects the septal microcirculation with signs of an increase in capillary permeability leading to an interstitial and epithelial destruction. The use of a membrane oxygenator prevents some of the alveolar lesions, as has been proved by the study of five pulmonary biopsies carried out in dogs submitted to ECC of long duration.

From the Arrhenius plot, pH-dependence and Lineweaver-Burk plots it can be concluded that this activation is not only due to stabilisation of the enzyme, but also influences the enzymatic activity. It is proposed that for optimal functioning human liver acid alpha-glucosidase needs a protein environment. 2. Glycogen has a competitive inhibitory effect on the hydrolysis of 4-methylumbelliferyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside, in contrast to maltose which exhibits a non-competitive type of inhibition. It is concluded that two catalytic sites exist, one for glycogen and one for maltose, while both sites influence each other. With glycogen as substrate a break in the Arrhenius plot is found. This is not the case when maltose is used as substrate. 3. The effect of antibody raised against human liver acid alpha-glucosidase on the activity of human liver acid alpha-glucosidase is studied.

The immediate effects on heart rate and blood pressure of withdrawing antihypertensive drugs were studied over three-day periods in 26 patients. Four groups of drugs were studied.

Patients taking postganglionic neurone-blocking drugs showed a similar but less pronounced reaction with increased ventricular ectopic activity. No alarming reactions were seen after withdrawal of methyldopa or beta-blocking drugs. Methyldopa and, especially, beta-blocking drugs are less likely to produce withdrawal reactions than clonidine or the postganglionic neurone-blocking drugs, and patients taking these drugs are therefore less likely to suffer violent reactions if they forget to take their tablets."

The response to antigen, given at various times after clinical recovery, gradually reappeared, but did not reach normal levels until 12 weeks after the injection of the parasite. A second injection of P. yoelii given 1 hr before SIII caused a moderate degree of depression, although in this case the plasmodium does not multiply. In chronic malaria the response to SIII was also very poor. Short term under-nourishment was found to reduce only slightly the response to SIII."

The patients receiving ketazolam experienced a greater reduction in symptomatology throughout the study when compared to the placebo group. Side-effects experienced by the ketazolam patients were less than, or equal to, the placebo patients. No deleterious side-effects occurred.

Response to antigen involves antigen recognition, cell proliferation, and synthesis and secretion of antibody. This study examines this sequence of events in peripheral blood lymphocytes from untreated and treated patients with myeloma, from individuals with benign monoclonal gammopathy, and from normal healthy donors. Antigen-binding capacity was assessed by testing the ability of lymphocytes to bind radio-labeled pneumococcal polysaccharide, tetanus toxoid, or diptheria toxin. The in vitro proliferative response to these antigens as well as to pokeweed mitogen and streptokinase-streptodornase was evaluated. The secretion of immunoglobulin in response to pneumococcal polysaccharide, tetanus toxoid, and pokeweed mitogen by 2-4 x 10(6) lymphocytes in 7-day cultures was determined. The effects of coculture of myeloma peripheral blood lymphocytes and normal peripheral blood lymphocytes on immunoglobulin production and mixed leukocyte reactions were explored. All myeloma patients had normal numbers (3-8/5,000 cells) of antigen-binding cells. However, most showed a diminished antigen-induced blast transformation as measured by uptake of [(125)I]5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine in culture. Immunoglobulin production in response to specific antigen in myeloma lymphocytes was 30-80% less than in normal lymphocytes. Immunoglobulin synthesis and mixed leukocyte responses by normal peripheral blood lymphocytes could be suppressed by myeloma lymphocytes. Multiple suppressor populations were present. Thus, the immune defect in myeloma is beyond the antigen recognition step and involves both the proliferation of antigen-sensitive cells and immunoglobulin production. Further suppressive effects are imposed on normal cells, implying defects in immunoregulation in this disease."

This study was designed to better define the mechanism of histamine-induced bronchoconstriction in humans by pharmacologic manipulation of the postulated bronchial histamine receptor sites. Histamine challenges were performed on a heterogeneous group of adult asthmatic subjects. The cumulative units of histamine required for induction of a sustained 20% or greater decrease in FEV1 from baseline were determined. The effect of pretreatment with an aerosolized H1 receptor antagonist, diphenhydramine hydrochloride, was then studied. Analysis of the data showed that the administration of an H1 receptor antagonist prior to histamine challenge significantly blocked the bronchial response to histamine (p less than 0.005). This effect was considered to be due to specific competitive antagonism at the H1 receptor site and suggests the presence of H1 receptors in human bronchial mucosa."

Isoleucine could not substitute for valine in producing increased carboxylase activity in these mutants. Glycine cleavage activity in fresh rat liver homogenates (11.1 micronmol/gm protein/90 min) did not vary significantly when 24 mM valine was added to the reaction (9.9 micronmol/mg protein/90 min). Therefore, the hyperglycinemia observed in both ketotic and nonketotic forms is probably not caused by a direct effect of valine on the glycine cleavage reaction. These data suggest that the presence of increased amounts of propionic acid in serum or urine does not necessarily rule out the possibility of nonketotic hyperglycinemia due to the decreased activity of the carboxylase enzyme."

When the condition had been present for sixteen months, an aortic arch syndrome developed in an inflammatory context.

The microbiological, clinical and therapeutic aspects of all (71) cases of bacterial endocarditis admitted to the Hôpital cantonal, Geneva, between August 1970 and October 1974 were reviewed: there was a definite trend towards higher prevalence of acute cases compared to subacute cases. The pathogenic role of S. epidermidis, mostly in cases of prosthetic valve endocarditis, could be demonstrated in several cases. When defined initially by microbiological criteria only, acute endocarditis were characterized by rapid evolution, destruction of the valvular structures (especially aortic valve), and by further evolution under adequate antibiotic therapy: thus, 10/25 patients with acute endocarditis died, whereas the mortality rate in the subacute cases was only 10/46. Many cases in our series showed one or more often frequent embolic phenomena: 70% of the cured cases and 80% of the patients with a fatal outcome. An unfavorable evolution could be correlated with neurologic involvement, cardiac rhythm or conduction disturbances, and/or heart failure; indeed, heart failure due to various mechanisms was the single most frequent cause of death and is presently the main therapeutic problem. Thus, acute infection leading to destruction of the aortic valve and to heart failure still carries a bad prognosis, even if emergency valve replacement is attempted. Finally, 22/30 patients who developed a bacterial endocarditis after oral or urological procedures knew about a heart murmur, but did not receive antibiotic prophylaxis. This clearly shows that emphasis should be put on the elaboration and diffusion of adequate prophylactic regimens."

A 6-month-old girl who presented with a prolonged unexplained fever and was subsequently demonstrated at post-mortem examination to have polyarteritis is described. The combination of polyarterits with some unusual presenting features suggests that the case described is one of the Mucocutaneous Lymph Node Syndrome (M.L.N.S.) or Kawasaki Disease. Polyarteritis and Kawasaki Disease are discussed with reference to the case described."

A group of 31 patients with idiopathic proctitis were colonoscoped while they were symptomatic. Multiple mucosal biopsies were taken from the transverse, descending, and sigmoid colon and from the rectum. While visualization by colonoscopy revealed abnormalities limited to the most distal 18-20 cm of the colon, microscopic abnormalities were frequently seen in more proximal locations. Analysis of clinicopathological data indicates that there is good correlation between the extent of microscopic mucosal abnormalities and the clinical course. Patients with abnormalities limited to the rectum generally responded well to conventional treatment while patients with more proximal involvement were refractory to such therapy."

According to the dopamine (DA) hypothesis of schizophrenia, there is a functional excess of dopaminergic activity within unspecified areas of the brain in schizophrenic patients. As a clinical test of this hypothesis, we administered metyrosine for three weeks to symptomatic chronic male schizophrenic patients who were maintained on suboptimal doses of neuroleptic agents. Metyrosine inhibits tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzymatic step in the synthesis of DA. No clinical improvement was observed, using the National Institute of Mental Health Inpatient Behavioral Rating Scale or the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. Central inhibition of DA synthesis by metyrosine was suggested, however, by (1) the development of extrapyramidal side effects and (2) a significant increase in plasma prolactin concentrations. Plasma chlorpromazine concentrations remained unchanged during metyrosine treatment. There was, nevertheless, a significant improvement on the scores of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Comprehension subtest, which measures judgment and common sense. This finding suggests that DA may be involved in the regulation of subtle psychological processes. The results are discussed in light of the DA hypothesis of schizophrenia and previous reports suggesting that metyrosine potentiates the antipsychotic effect of neuroleptics in schizophrenia."

As expected, the FAD content of each tissue was greater than that of FMN.

Possible relationships between the flavin content of the islets and their capacity for oxidative phosphorylation are briefly discussed."

Determinations of galactocerebrosidase activity had required the use of galactocerebroside labeled with radiocarbon or radiohydrogen. These materials are expensive and their use is restricted to laboratories with radioactive counting facilities. An analogue of galactocerebroside, 2-hexadecanoylamino-4-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside, was synthesized. The hydrolysis of this analogue by extracts of tissues and cells from patients with Krabbe's disease is greatly reduced from normal levels. Cultured skin fibroblasts preparations derived from heterozygous carriers of Krabbe's disease have an intermediate level of hydrolytic activity. Thus, the analogue is a reliable chromogenic reagent for the diagnosis of patients with Krabbe's disease and for the detection of heterozygous carriers of the Krabbe trait."

KCl stimulated the activity of the Peak II enzyme but it strongly inhibited the activity of the Peak I enzyme measured at pH 4.0. Decreases in the urinary alpha-glucosidase activity measured at pH 4.0 with added KCl and the ratio of the activity at pH 4.0 with added KCl/the activity at pH 6.5 without KCl may aid in the detection of homozygotes or heterozygotes with the adult form of Pompe's disease."

In view of data suggesting that deficiency of gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) may be the primary abnormality in the small-intestinal mucosa of patients with coeliac disease, this enzyme was measured in mucosal biopsies from coeliac patients at different stages of treatment. Activity was only slightly reduced in only one of nine well-treated patients, suggesting that deficiency of this enzyme has no primary role in the aetiology of coeliac disease."

A patient with biopsy documented acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis and arteritis recovered completely with supportive therapy. Illness was preceded by group A streptococcal pharyngitis. At the time of presentation, serum creatinine concentration was 11.5 mg/dl. Serum cryoglobulins containing IgG and C3 were present. The first biopsy, performed during the acute illness, contained glomeruli with typical features of acute PSGN. Medium-sized arteries had extensive necrosis and leukocytic infiltration, and contained IgG, C3, and fibrin. Glomerular filtration rate returned to normal within three weeks; proteinuria cleared by three months, and microscopic hematuria by 11 months. Renal biopsy one year later showed minimal mesangial hypercellularity and no arteritis."

Stereoselective investigations of potential anti-parkinsonian, antipsychotic, and anticonvulsant activities. The chiral title compounds 2--11 were assessed for their potential anti-Parkinsonian, antipsychotic, and anticonvulsant properties. The most striking differences in the biological activity of enantiomeric pairs were noted for D-(R)-2-amino-N-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)succinimide hydrochloride (2) vs. L-(S)-3 and D-(R)-2-amino-N-(3,4-isopropylidenedioxyphenyl)succinimide (4) vs. L-(S)-5. D-(R)-2-partially attenuated amphetamine-induced stereotyped behavior, whereas D-(R)-4 antagonized oxotremorine-induced tremors. Their respective enantiomorphs were inactive in these tests. No differences in anticonvulsant potency of enantiomeric pairs were observed. The stereoselective actions of D-(R)-2 and 4 were rationalized on the basis of the presence or absence of gem-dimethyl functions in isopropylidenedioxy vs. methylenedioxy groups; the data seem to indicate that these methyl groups influence selective receptor site interaction in the D-(R) series."

In the histamine H2-receptor antagonist metiamide (2a) isosteric replacement of thione sulfur (=S) by carbonyl oxygen (=O) or imino nitrogen (=NH) affords the urea 2c and guanidine 2d which are antagonists of decreased potency. The guanidine is very basic and at physiological pH is completely protonated. However, introduction of strongly electronegative substituents into the guanidine group reduces basicity and gives potent H2-receptor antagonists, viz. the cyanoguanidine 2b (cimetidine, \"Tagamet\") and nitroguanidine 2e. A correspondence between the activity of thioureas and cyanoguanidines is demonstrated for a series of structures 1-4. The close correspondence between cyanoguanidine and thiourea in many physicochemical properties and the pharmacological equivalence of these groups in H2-receptor antagonists leads to the description of cyanoguanidine and thiourea as bioisosteres. Acid hydrolysis of the cyanoguanidine 2b yields the carbamoylguanidine 2f at ambient temperatures and the guanidine 2d at elevated temperatures. Cimetidine is slightly more active than metiamide in vivo as an inhibitor of histamine-stimulated gastric acid secretion and has clinical use in the treatment of peptic ulcer and associated gastrointestinal disorders."

Both the 4-methylumbelliferyl glycoside and the p-nitrophenyl derivative were used as substrates. pH activity profiles showed two major peaks of activity. With the fluorogenic substrate pH optimum was at 4.5, whereas with the colorigenic substrate maximum activity was at pH 5.7. No activity was found in the fibroblasts of the three patients with the colorimetric assay. With the fluorometric assay the mean activity in the two patients with fucosidosis type 2 was 4.1 and 2.8 (range 1.3-9.9); activity in the patient with fucosidosis type 1 was 4.6 nmol 4-methylumbelliferone/mg protein/hr (range 1.0-8.6). The specific activity in the lysates of the patients' fibroblasts decreased as the amount of cellular protein used per assay increased. Fucosidosis fibroblasts cultured for 3 and 5 days in medium without fetal calf serum showed almost the same levels of apparent residual activity as fibroblasts cultured in medium containing fetal calf serum. Maximum activity in the deficient fibroblasts was at pH 4.5-4.75. Mixing experiments between lysates of both of fucosidosis and a normal fibroblast strain showed the expected enzymatic activities. The mean alpha-fucosidase activity in four heterozygotes for fucosidosis was 37.6 (range 24.1-48.7) and 30.3 (range 19.0-44.1) nmol final product split/mg protein/hr with the fluorogenic and the colorigenic substrate, respectively. In 12 normal fibroblast strains the mean activity +/- SD was 85.3 +/- 24.4 (range 50.8-129.3) and 67.6 +/- 21.1 (range 31.1-118.3). However, in four family members in which the alpha-L-fucosidase phenotype (by isoelectric focusing) was type 2-1, and who should therefore be carrying two normal alleles, the activity was within the heterozygote range. This indicates that occasional overlap between normal subjects and carriers may be present in cultured skin fibroblasts. Increased specific activity of alpha-L-fucosidase at pH 3.2-4.0 was observed after incubation of cell lysates with neuraminidase. The alpha-L-fucosidase activity did not show any increase after fusion between fucosidosis fibroblasts type 1 and 2."

Examinations for soluble bacterial antigens using counter-immunoelectrophoresis (C.I.E.) was carried out in 151 patients suspected of suffering from various infectious syndrome were successful for S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae b, N. meningitis, sero-group B and D streptococcus. Thus meningitis and pneumonia represent those areas in which the technique is particularly useful. Apart from its rapidity--result in a hour--C.I.E., in association with bacteriology, makes possible an increase in aetiological diagnosis of 27% with H. influenzae b, 24% with S. pneumoniae and 6% with N. meningitidis (lower result by virtue of technical difficulties with sero-group B). Thus using this technique we were able to reach an aetiological diagnosis in 10 (23.8%) out of 42 cases of purulent meningitis where blind antibiotic therapy had already been given. These two advantages--rapidity and increase in aetiological diagnosis--justify the introduction of this simple technique in every medical microbiology laboratory."

The pathological changes underlying the latter disorder are not well known; they are considered to be indistinguishable from infantile polyarteritis nodosa. A diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa was also thought to be most likely to apply in the cases presented here, particularly in view of the frequency with which aneurysms of the coronary arteries have been found in this disorder. In the absence of valid pathological distinctions between Kawasaki's disease and infantile polyarteritis nodosa, the question arises whether these entities are, in fact, different, and whether Kawasaki's disease is the new entity it is assumed to be."

The sudden occlusion of the large mesenteric arteries (a. mesenterica superior (more frequently) and inferior) is followed by intestinal gangrene and peritonitis with a poor prognosis and a high letality (greater than 90%). In chronic intestinal ischemia the leading clinical symptom is postprandial pain ('claudicatio intestinalis'). In some cases of acute mesenteric artery occlusion no embolus or thrombus will be found. In these cases the circulation in the arteriosclerotic vessels falls below a critical value due to cardiac insufficiency, shock, digitalis overdose and others. In less severe ischemia the mucosa is involved being most sensitive to O2 deprivation. It usually regenerates within a few days. This form is found more frequently in the colon than in other parts of the gut (about 40%): ischemic colitis. The therapy - if possible in acute, fulminant ischemia or if necessary in chronic intestinal ischemia - is surgical consisting in reconstructive procedures of the mesenteric circulation."

Trained rats show a different behaviour in glucose tolerance test depending on their age and seriousness of diabetes: Glucose tolerance is improved in grown-up rats with a mild diabetes and unchanged in old rats. Six-week run-training causes a significant deterioration of glucose tolerance in rats with a medium seriously Streptozotocin-diabetes and even leads to death of old rats because of decompensated metabolism. Grown-up rats with a mild diabetes stand run-stress after run-training better than the old ones. No animal with a medium seriously diabetes survives maximal run-stress, old rats don't even survive the slowly increasing run-training. - These results confirm the dualistic effect of muscular work. Metabolism of mild diabetes becomes better through muscular exertion the one of medium diabetes gets worse. Therefore a good effect of run-training is measurable only in grown-up rats not in old ones."

As a result, the lens increases in weight and a subcapsular (permeability) cataract develops. It is shown that the cattle lens in vitro increases in weight the lower the pH (6.5 greater than 7.5 greater than 8.5) of the surrounding fluid becomes. In a further experiment, 1 ml of buffered liquids with different pH were injected into the anterior chamber of the eyes of freshly slaughtered cattle. Here, too, the mechanically undamaged, untouched lens increased in weight more greatly as the pH (5.5 greater than 6.5 greater than 7.5 greater than 8.5) of the injected fluid was lowered.

There are, on the other hand, relatively small differences between GTase activities in the ascending, transverse and descending portions of the large intestine. GTase activity in the colon of neonatal rat is several times higher than in the colon of adult rats.

Neonatal hyperthyroidism in rats induced by daily administration of L-triiodothyronine for 30 days since birth resulted in a significant rise in mobility and the metabolism of brain norepinephrine and dopamine. Whereas administration of lithium carbonate (60 mg/kg ip) to normal rats for 6 days produced no effect on spontaneous locomotor activity and increased the synthesis and possibly release of this monoamine in several brain regions, this antimanic drug antagonized the L-triiodothyronine-stimulated increases in mobility as well as norepinephrine and dopamine metabolism of hypothalamus, midbrain, striatum, and cerebral cortex. Furthermore, lithium treatment restored the activity of catechol-O-methyl transferase (EC 2.1.1.6) in young hyperthyroid rats to virtually normal limits. Our data suggest that antiphasic or damping effects of lithium upon mood swings is controlled, at least in part, by catecholaminergic systems in the brain. The interrelationship between brain catecholamines and thyroid hormones seems to be important to our understanding of the action of lithium in affective illness."

Toxicity due to drugs primarily used for treating cardiovascular toxicity. Toxicity due to drugs primarily used for treating cardiac disorders is the most extensively documented, especially the arrhythmias due to digitalis glycosides. Various arrhythmias are also caused by toxic levels of many antiarrhythmic agents including quinidine, procainamide and phenytotin. Myocardial depression and heart failure are serious side-effects of beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents and myocardial ischaemia due to sympathominetic amines may result from both direct and indirect mechanisms. The many toxic reactions in the cardiovascular system due to non-cardiac drugs are less widely known and for the most part less clearly understood. Many remain controversial at the current time; for example, the diathesis toward thromboembolism in women taking oral contraceptives. Potential cardiac toxicity due to drugs used in the rapidly expanding sphere of anti-neoplastic chemotherapy is exemplified by the cardiomyopathy-like toxicities of doxorubicin and daunorubicin.

The study was undertaken to investigate the acute haemodynamic effects of bunitrolol (0-2-hydroxy-3-(tert.butylamino)-propoxy)-bity. Right and left heart catheterization was performed in eleven patients with documented coronary artery disease. After bunitrolol (10 mg i.v.), there was a statistically significant decrease in left ventricular and aortic systolic pressures left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, aortic diastolic and mean pressures, pressure-rate product and compliance index (delta P/delta V).  Left ventricular dp/dt, left ventricular dp/dt over isovolumic pressure, systemic resistance and heart rate tended to decrease, stroke volume and left ventricular stroke work index tended to increase, without statistical significance. Cardiac index showed individual variations, the mean values for the group being unchanged. Correlation of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and left ventricular stroke work index showed a shift toward improved ventricular function curve in most cases, deterioration in no instance. Supine exercise was performed in ten patients. Angina occurred in nine patients; in five only before and in four before and after beta-blockade. Post-drug exercise heart rate, pressure-rate product and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure were significantly lower, the latter also in the four patients who still presented exercise angina. It is concluded that certain beta-blockers can improve cardiac performance at rest and during exercise in patients with coronary artery disease. This is explainable on the basis of a more favourable balance between oxygen supply and demand, together with a less marked negative inotropic effect due to the partial agonist activity of the agent used in the study."

Thirty-four anxious patients with gastrointestinal disorders were studied in order to evaluate the effectiveness of a new 1,5-benzodiazepine antianxiety agent (HR 376). The disorders were classified as organic or functional according to the presence or absence of radiologic signs of ulcer. Dietetic measures, gastric antacids, anticholinergic agents, and antianxiety treatment were applied for six weeks. Anxiolytic treatment consisted of 30 mg/day clobazam (HR 376) or 15 mg/day diazepam, given in a randomized, double-blind manner. Clinical follow-up was performed with the PEN Personality Inventory (PEN), Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale (TMAS), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAS), and Wittenborn Psychiatric Rating Scales (WPRS). The score of the psychoticism dimension of the PEN inventory was significantly higher in organic than in functional patients. Significant differences occurred in the reduction of the rating scores of HAS and WPRS before/after treatment in the clobazam and diazepam groups. This would express a modification of state anxiety. The TMAS, which evaluates trait anxiety, disclosed statistically significant improvement in the clobazam group. This group showed an early reduction of the HAS and TMAS scores, which would suggest an early onset of action."

We recently studied cases of 58 children, aged from 5 to 9 years, who had acute otitis media. Haemophilus species were the causative agents in 36% of cases. This high incidence of Haemophilus isolation from the middle ear exudate of these children has important therapeutic implications; antibiotics effective against H influenzae should be employed when dealing with otitis media in this older age group."

The patients had a normal airway resistance at rest and developed a marked bronchoconstriction (EIB) during exercise, which could be prevented by previous alpha-adrenergic blockade with phentolamine. In 7 control persons NE and E levels were measured also after beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol. The following results were obtained: 1. At rest NE levels showed no significant differences between the groups. After exercise an increase of NE was observed in all groups, but in patients, even after phentolamine, and in normals after propranolol the increase was significantly higher than in the normal group within the control test. 2. No significant differences between the groups were found in E levels at rest and after exercise. Exercise caused no significant increase of E levels, except in the normals after propranolol application. 3. No significant correlation existed between NE levels and the increase of airway resistance after exercise. It is concluded that during exercise in asthmatics the sympathetic activity is enhanced, but the provocation of an EIB does not seem to be mediated by enhanced plasma NE levels."

Eight patients had convulsions, six with ensuing permanent defects. Severe polymyositis was observed in one case. Five infants died 12 h to 4 days after vaccination: two after acute encephalopathy and three in the form of a sudden unexpected death (SID). In two fatal cases the morphological changes in the brain corresponded to those of pertussis encephalopathy: neuronal degeneration in various parts of the cortex, especially in the region of the ammons horn, and in the cerebellum. There were no signs of inflammation. Three cases underwent forensic autopsy and death was attributed to bronchopulmonary infection. Complete neuropathological work-up was only done in one case, in which the brain was normal. The critique of episodical reports and the demand for prospective studies is appreciated. Knowledge of all possible forms of complications, however, is indispensable for future investigations. Polymyositis and SID have so far not been listed as abnormal reactions to immunization. The majority of our cases became known accidentally from hospital sheets or from discussions with collegues. For a detection of all possible cases a greater awareness of doctors for the problem of pertussis immunization appears necessary. Only another 23 cases have been reported to the health authorities of the state of Lower Saxony during the last 6 to 7 years. Of those, nine were either harmless reactions or diseases probably unrelated to vaccination. Two were cases of SID, 12 and 72 h after vaccination. It is concluded that only a minor proportion of possible complications is presently reported to the health authorities."

Basal gastro-oesophageal sphincter pressure was recorded in 68 patients with symptomatic, radiologically verified sliding hiatus hernia, and in 37 healthy subjects. The diameter of the probe was 2.5 mm, and the flow rate 0.5 ml/min. Mean sphincter pressure was lower in patients (6 mm Hg) than in normal subjects (15 mm Hg). In 32 per cent of the patients sphincter pressure was within normal range (8-24 mm Hg), whereas in 68 per cent it was lower than in the normal subjects. There seemed to be no relationship between sphincter pressure and severity of symptoms. Oesophageal acid clearing was investigated in 57 of the patients and in 26 of the normal subjects. Normal subjects clear the bolus of acid in an average of 10 swallows (range 4-16). In patients the incidence of prolonged clearing was greater, but the acid-clearing ability did not seem to be related to the degree of severity of the symptoms. A manometric study was made of 45 patients and an acid-clearing study made of 40 patients, before and 3 months after a modified Belsey MK IV repair for hiatal hernia. Mean postoperative sphincter pressure was higher (10 mm Hg) than the preoperative mean (6 mm Hg), but was still lower than the normal mean. Significant changes in acid-clearing ability could not be demonstrated. The results are inconclusive with regard to the importance of oesophageal motility disturbances for the symptomatology and acid-clearing ability.

Complex clinical and clinico-biochemical examination of the blood, urine and rumen liquor in a herd of dairy cows revealed chronical metabolic acidosis accompanied by rumen dysfunction and by a reduced butterfat content of milk. During the first examination of the acid-base state of the blood was almost at a standard level. An increased level of urea in blood plasma and a higher GOT transaminase activity testified to an excessive load on the liver. Urine pH was considerably deviated towards the acidic side and inorganic phosphorus was present in urine in a greater concentration. The pH of rumen liquor was slightly shifted towards alkalinity owing to the release of NH3 from urea in the food ration. The diagnosis--suspect chronical metabolic acidosis--was determined on the basis of the first examination. Chronical metabolic acidosis was definitely proved by the second examination when urea had been excluded from the feed ration. Repeated examinations revealed chronical metabolic acidosis which had originally been accompanied by a higher rumen liquor pH. On the basis of case histories and mechanisms of chronical acidosis, measures were proposed, resulting in an increase of the butterfat content of milk. Chronical metabolic disorders often follow a long-lasting latent pattern, manifesting themselves as a reduced milk yield and lower resistance; the clinical form of disease appears only at a later stage. The system of preventive diagnostics provides information on the changes in the composition of internal medium and of the faeces before a drop occurs in milk and fat production. These measures prevent metabolic disorders and high losses of produce which otherwise remain hidden for a long time."

The respiratory pathophysiology of A2 influenza infection was studied in mice treated with small-particle aerosols (SPA) of rimantadine or ribavirin. Untreated infections in mice resulted in survival rates of 15% or less and were characterized by (i) severe hypoventilation (decreased P(O2) and increased P(CO2)), (ii) compensated respiratory acidosis (increased P(CO2) and HCO(3) (-), with normal pH), (iii) pneumonia with increased ratio of wet/dry lung weight, and (iv) hypothermia. Treatment with SPA of rimantadine (21 mg/kg per day for 4 days) beginning 72 h after virus challenge significantly improved survival rate (80%) but failed to alter lung pathology from that found in infected, untreated mice. Rimantadine treatment decreased somewhat the severity of hypoventilation, respiratory acidosis, lung wet weight, hypothermia, and lung virus titers from that observed in infected, untreated mice. SPA of ribavirin (26 mg/kg per day for 4 days) initiated 6 h after SPA exposure of mice to virus significantly improved survival rate (95%) and reduced lung virus titers and lung pathology. Gas exchange and pulmonary edema in ribavirin-treated, infected mice were significantly improved over those of infected, untreated controls. The mechanisms for increased survival rates induced by SPA of rimantadine remain uncertain, since increased survival rates could not be ascribed entirely to improvements in lung functions. In contrast, however, ribavirin treatment appeared to improve survival rates by reducing major lung pathology and pulmonary dysfunction. This was probably mediated through the antiviral effects of ribavirin."

The unusually high relative frequency of cancer in the laryngeal region in males (18% of all histologically diagnosed cancers) and a sex ratio of unity for lung cancer in Northern Thailand were further explored in a hospital-based case-control study in Chiang Mai. This compared patients having cancers of the oral cavity (including oropharynx), larynx, hypopharynx and lung, with controls in relation to smoking and chewing habits. Statistical analysis indicated that chewing betel is strongly associated with the occurrence of oral cancer in both sexes, and with cancer of the laryngeal region in males. No factors were strongly linked to lung cancer in men, but, in women, urban residence and miang chewing were associated with lung cancer. Analysis of smoke from the two main types of cigars smoked in the region showed that both had high tar content, but there were marked differences in pH. Smoking cigars with alkaline smoke and high tar had an increased risk for laryngeal cancer in males, whereas other cigars with acid smoke and high tar together with manufactured cigarettes had increased risks for lung cancer. These increased risks were not, however, statistically significant."

During the course of venesection therapy there was a progressive rise in isoferritins of pI 5.02-5.06 relative to the more basic isoferritins. These observations are consistent with previous studies showing alterations in tissue isoferritins in untreated IHC before and after venesection therapy and they are compatible with the hypothesis that the more basic isoferritins correspond to a 'storage' ferritin and the more acidic to a 'secretory' ferritin. The studies also provide further evidence for a possible biological role of the individual isoferritins."

Deformability of erythrocytes from four patients with different types of glucosephosphate isomerase (D-glucose-6-phosphate ketoisomerase, GPI) deficiency has been determined by cell filtration. Young as well as whole erythrocyte populations had a markedly increased rigidity and an abnormally strong attachment of haemoglobin to the inner surface of isolated membranes. Acidic environment may enhance membran rigidity in vitro and also during passage of the erythrocytes through the spleen. The decrease of deformability at a pH of 6.8 was most pronounced in the splenectomized patients, and likewise in erythrocytes from the splenic artery, which were obtained from one patient during splenectomy. It is suggested that the metabolic environment of the spleen, with its low pH, impairs the deformability of GPI-deficient erythrocytes and predisposes them to splenic sequestration. The clinical improvement of all patients following splenectomy which is accompanied by an increase of the erythrocyte survival time and by unchanged reticulocyte counts, is in accordance with this view."

Twenty-five patients, 16 men and 9 women, 5-59 years of age with the Marfan syndrome and cardiac complications were started on propranolol over a 6-year period. Propranolol was used as a beta-adrenergic blocking agent to reduce myocardial contractility in an attempt thereby to stay the progression of aortic dilatation and to prevent acute dissection of the aorta. The indications for prophylactic treatment were aortic dilatation, with aortic regurgitation in most cases. It was intended to keep the pulse rate below 70 at all times or below 60 at rest. Propranolol given in daily doses of 120-160 mg caused no side effects. The mean observation time for propranolol treatment in the 25 patients was 3.0 +/- 1.8 years ranging from 1-7 years. In spite of treatment, 5 patients (1 female and 4 males) experienced acute aortic dissection of rupture with fatal outcome. This occurred in 2 patients with the asthenic type, in 2 patients with the nonasthenic type, and in 1 patient with the marfanoid hypermobility syndrome. Serial echocardiograms showed that other patients on propranolol developed increasing dilatation of the aortic root. These observations indicate that propranolol does not necessarily protect against aortic dissection nor stop the progression of the aortic dilatation when cystic medial necrosis of the aorta is already present."
